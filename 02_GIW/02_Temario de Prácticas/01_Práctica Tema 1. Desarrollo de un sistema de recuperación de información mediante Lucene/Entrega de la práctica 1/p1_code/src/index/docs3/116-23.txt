He was a\r\nstranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made\r\nhis escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his\r\ncuriosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the\r\nabolitionists,\xe2\x80\x94of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while\r\nhe was a slave,\xe2\x80\x94he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion\r\nalluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.\r\n\r\nFortunate, most fortunate occurrence!\xe2\x80\x94fortunate for the millions of his\r\nmanacled brethren, yet panting for deliverance from their awful\r\nthraldom!\xe2\x80\x94fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation, and of\r\nuniversal liberty!\xe2\x80\x94fortunate for the land of his birth, which he has\r\nalready done so much to save and bless!\xe2\x80\x94fortunate for a large circle of\r\nfriends and acquaintances, whose sympathy and affection he has strongly\r\nsecured by the many sufferings he has endured, by his virtuous traits\r\nof character, by his ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in\r\nbonds, as being bound with them!\xe2\x80\x94fortunate for the multitudes, in\r\nvarious parts of our republic, whose minds he has enlightened on the\r\nsubject of slavery, and who have been melted to tears by his pathos, or\r\nroused to virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence against the\r\nenslavers of men!\xe2\x80\x94fortunate for himself, as it at once brought him into\r\nthe field of public usefulness, \xe2\x80\x9cgave the world assurance of a MAN,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nquickened the slumbering energies of his soul, and consecrated him to\r\nthe great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor, and letting the\r\noppressed go free!\r\n\r\nI shall never forget his first speech at the convention\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nextraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind\xe2\x80\x94the powerful impression\r\nit created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise\xe2\x80\x94the\r\napplause which followed from the beginning to the end of his felicitous\r\nremarks. I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment;\r\ncertainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by\r\nit, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear\r\nthan ever. There stood one, in physical proportion and stature\r\ncommanding and exact\xe2\x80\x94in intellect richly endowed\xe2\x80\x94in natural eloquence a\r\nprodigy\xe2\x80\x94in soul manifestly \xe2\x80\x9ccreated but a little lower than the\r\nangels\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94yet a slave, ay, a fugitive slave,\xe2\x80\x94trembling for his safety,\r\nhardly daring to believe that on the American soil, a single white\r\nperson could be found who would befriend him at all hazards, for the\r\nlove of God and humanity! Capable of high attainments as an\r\nintellectual and moral being\xe2\x80\x94needing nothing but a comparatively small\r\namount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing\r\nto his race\xe2\x80\x94by the law of the land, by the voice of the people, by the\r\nterms of the slave code, he was only a piece of property, a beast of\r\nburden, a chattel personal, nevertheless!\r\n\r\nA beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr. DOUGLASS  to address\r\nthe convention. He came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and\r\nembarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a\r\nnovel position. After apologizing for his ignorance, and reminding the\r\naudience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and\r\nheart, he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as\r\na slave, and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble\r\nthoughts and thrilling reflections. As soon as he had taken his seat,\r\nfilled with hope and admiration, I rose, and declared that PATRICK\r\nHENRY, of revolutionary fame, never made a speech more eloquent in the\r\ncause of liberty, than the one we had just listened to from the lips of\r\nthat hunted fugitive. So I believed at that time\xe2\x80\x94such is my belief now.\r\nI reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this\r\nself-emancipated young man at the North,\xe2\x80\x94even in Massachusetts, on the\r\nsoil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary\r\nsires; and I appealed to them, whether they would ever allow him to be\r\ncarried back into slavery,\xe2\x80\x94law or no law, constitution or no\r\nconstitution. The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you succor and protect him as a brother-man\xe2\x80\x94a resident of the old\r\nBay State?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYES!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the whole mass, with an energy so startling,\r\nthat the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s line might almost\r\nhave heard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge\r\nof an invincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never\r\nto betray him that wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to\r\nabide the consequences.\r\n\r\nIt was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if Mr. DOUGLASS\r\ncould be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion\r\nof the anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to\r\nit, and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern\r\nprejudice against a colored complexion. I therefore endeavored to\r\ninstil hope and courage into his mind, in order that he might dare to\r\nengage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his\r\nsituation; and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends,\r\nespecially by the late General Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, Mr. JOHN A. COLLINS, whose judgment in this instance entirely\r\ncoincided with my own. At first, he could give no encouragement; with\r\nunfeigned diffidence, he expressed his conviction that he was not\r\nadequate to the performance of so great a task; the path marked out was\r\nwholly an untrodden one; he was sincerely apprehensive that he should\r\ndo more harm than good. After much deliberation, however, he consented\r\nto make a trial; and ever since that period, he has acted as a\r\nlecturing agent, under the auspices either of the American or the\r\nMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. In labors he has been most\r\nabundant; and his success in combating prejudice, in gaining\r\nproselytes, in agitating the public mind, has far surpassed the most\r\nsanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his\r\nbrilliant career. He has borne himself with gentleness and meekness,\r\nyet with true manliness of character. As a public speaker, he excels in\r\npathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning, and fluency\r\nof language. There is in him that union of head and heart, which is\r\nindispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the\r\nhearts of others. May his strength continue to be equal to his day! May\r\nhe continue to \xe2\x80\x9cgrow in grace, and in the knowledge of God,\xe2\x80\x9d that he\r\nmay be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity,\r\nwhether at home or abroad!\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of the most efficient\r\nadvocates of the slave population, now before the public, is a fugitive\r\nslave, in the person of _Frederick Douglass_; and that the free colored\r\npopulation of the United States are as ably represented by one of their\r\nown number, in the person of _Charles Lenox Remond_, whose eloquent\r\nappeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic. Let the calumniators of the colored race despise\r\nthemselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit, and\r\nhenceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who\r\nrequire nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point\r\nof human excellence.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any other portion of the\r\npopulation of the earth could have endured the privations, sufferings\r\nand horrors of slavery, without having become more degraded in the\r\nscale of humanity than the slaves of African descent. Nothing has been\r\nleft undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase\r\ntheir moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to\r\nmankind; and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of\r\na most frightful bondage, under which they have been groaning for\r\ncenturies! To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nshow that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior\r\nto those of his black brother,\xe2\x80\x94_Daniel O\xe2\x80\x99Connell_, the distinguished\r\nadvocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of\r\nprostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in\r\na speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the\r\nLoyal National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n_Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Connell_, \xe2\x80\x9cunder what specious term it may disguise itself,\r\nslavery is still hideous. _It has a natural, an inevitable tendency to\r\nbrutalize every noble faculty of man._ An American sailor, who was cast\r\naway on the shore of Africa, where he was kept in slavery for three\r\nyears, was, at the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted and\r\nstultified\xe2\x80\x94he had lost all reasoning power; and having forgotten his\r\nnative language, could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic\r\nand English, which nobody could understand, and which even he himself\r\nfound difficulty in pronouncing. So much for the humanizing influence\r\nof _The Domestic Institution_!\xe2\x80\x9d Admitting this to have been an\r\nextraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least that the\r\nwhite slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Douglass_ has very properly chosen to write his own Narrative, in\r\nhis own style, and according to the best of his ability, rather than to\r\nemploy some one else. It is, therefore, entirely his own production;\r\nand, considering how long and dark was the career he had to run as a\r\nslave,\xe2\x80\x94how few have been his opportunities to improve his mind since he\r\nbroke his iron fetters,\xe2\x80\x94it is, in my judgment, highly creditable to his\r\nhead and heart. He who can peruse it without a tearful eye, a heaving\r\nbreast, an afflicted spirit,\xe2\x80\x94without being filled with an unutterable\r\nabhorrence of slavery and all its abettors, and animated with a\r\ndetermination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable\r\nsystem,\xe2\x80\x94without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of\r\na righteous God, who is ever on the side of the oppressed, and whose\r\narm is not shortened that it cannot save,\xe2\x80\x94must have a flinty heart, and\r\nbe qualified to act the part of a trafficker \xe2\x80\x9cin slaves and the souls\r\nof men.\xe2\x80\x9d I am confident that it is essentially true in all its\r\nstatements; that nothing has been set down in malice, nothing\r\nexaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination; that it comes short of\r\nthe reality, rather than overstates a single fact in regard to _slavery\r\nas it is_. The experience of _Frederick Douglass_, as a slave, was not\r\na peculiar one; his lot was not especially a hard one; his case may be\r\nregarded as a very fair specimen of the treatment of slaves in\r\nMaryland, in which State it is conceded that they are better fed and\r\nless cruelly treated than in Georgia, Alabama, or Louisiana. Many have\r\nsuffered incomparably more, while very few on the plantations have\r\nsuffered less, than himself. Yet how deplorable was his situation! what\r\nterrible chastisements were inflicted upon his person! what still more\r\nshocking outrages were perpetrated upon his mind! with all his noble\r\npowers and sublime aspirations, how like a brute was he treated, even\r\nby those professing to have the same mind in them that was in Christ\r\nJesus! to what dreadful liabilities was he continually subjected! how\r\ndestitute of friendly counsel and aid, even in his greatest\r\nextremities! how heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded in\r\nblackness the last ray of hope, and filled the future with terror and\r\ngloom! what longings after freedom took possession of his breast, and\r\nhow his misery augmented, in proportion as he grew reflective and\r\nintelligent,\xe2\x80\x94thus demonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man!\r\nhow he thought, reasoned, felt, under the lash of the driver, with the\r\nchains upon his limbs! what perils he encountered in his endeavors to\r\nescape from his horrible doom! and how signal have been his deliverance\r\nand preservation in the midst of a nation of pitiless enemies!\r\n\r\nThis Narrative contains many affecting incidents, many passages of\r\ngreat eloquence and power; but I think the most thrilling one of them\r\nall is the description _Douglass_ gives of his feelings, as he stood\r\nsoliloquizing respecting his fate, and the chances of his one day being\r\na freeman, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay\xe2\x80\x94viewing the receding\r\nvessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze, and\r\napostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom. Who\r\ncan read that passage, and be insensible to its pathos and sublimity?\r\nCompressed into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought, feeling,\r\nand sentiment\xe2\x80\x94all that can, all that need be urged, in the form of\r\nexpostulation, entreaty, rebuke, against that crime of crimes,\xe2\x80\x94making\r\nman the property of his fellow-man! O, how accursed is that system,\r\nwhich entombs the godlike mind of man, defaces the divine image,\r\nreduces those who by creation were crowned with glory and honor to a\r\nlevel with four-footed beasts, and exalts the dealer in human flesh\r\nabove all that is called God! Why should its existence be prolonged one\r\nhour? Is it not evil, only evil, and that continually? What does its\r\npresence imply but the absence of all fear of God, all regard for man,\r\non the part of the people of the United States? Heaven speed its\r\neternal overthrow!\r\n\r\nSo profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons, that\r\nthey are stubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any\r\nrecital of the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims. They\r\ndo not deny that the slaves are held as property; but that terrible\r\nfact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice, exposure to\r\noutrage, or savage barbarity. Tell them of cruel scourgings, of\r\nmutilations and brandings, of scenes of pollution and blood, of the\r\nbanishment of all light and knowledge, and they affect to be greatly\r\nindignant at such enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstatements,\r\nsuch abominable libels on the character of the southern planters! As if\r\nall these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery! As\r\nif it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a\r\nthing, than to give him a severe flagellation, or to deprive him of\r\nnecessary food and clothing! As if whips, chains, thumb-screws,\r\npaddles, blood-hounds, overseers, drivers, patrols, were not all\r\nindispensable to keep the slaves down, and to give protection to their\r\nruthless oppressors! As if, when the marriage institution is abolished,\r\nconcubinage, adultery, and incest, must not necessarily abound; when\r\nall the rights of humanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to\r\nprotect the victim from the fury of the spoiler; when absolute power is\r\nassumed over life and liberty, it will not be wielded with destructive\r\nsway! Skeptics of this character abound in society. In some few\r\ninstances, their incredulity arises from a want of reflection; but,\r\ngenerally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire to shield\r\nslavery from the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored race,\r\nwhether bond or free. Such will try to discredit the shocking tales of\r\nslaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative; but\r\nthey will labor in vain. _Mr. Douglass_ has frankly disclosed the place\r\nof his birth, the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and\r\nsoul, and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he has\r\nalleged against them. His statements, therefore, may easily be\r\ndisproved, if they are untrue.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his Narrative, he relates two instances of murderous\r\ncruelty,\xe2\x80\x94in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging\r\nto a neighboring plantation, who had unintentionally gotten within his\r\nlordly domain in quest of fish; and in the other, an overseer blew out\r\nthe brains of a slave who had fled to a stream of water to escape a\r\nbloody scourging. _Mr. Douglass_ states that in neither of these\r\ninstances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial\r\ninvestigation. The Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845, relates a\r\nsimilar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Shooting a slave._\xe2\x80\x94We learn, upon the authority of a letter\r\nfrom Charles county, Maryland, received by a gentleman of this city,\r\nthat a young man, named Matthews, a nephew of General Matthews, and\r\nwhose father, it is believed, holds an office at Washington, killed one\r\nof the slaves upon his father\xe2\x80\x99s farm by shooting him. The letter states\r\nthat young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm; that he gave\r\nan order to the servant, which was disobeyed, when he proceeded to the\r\nhouse, _obtained a gun, and, returning, shot the servant._ He\r\nimmediately, the letter continues, fled to his father\xe2\x80\x99s residence,\r\nwhere he still remains unmolested.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Let it never be forgotten, that no\r\nslaveholder or overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on\r\nthe person of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on the testimony\r\nof colored witnesses, whether bond or free. By the slave code, they are\r\nadjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though\r\nthey were indeed a part of the brute creation. Hence, there is no legal\r\nprotection in fact, whatever there may be in form, for the slave\r\npopulation; and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with\r\nimpunity. Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more\r\nhorrible state of society?\r\n\r\nThe effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters\r\nis vividly described in the following Narrative, and shown to be any\r\nthing but salutary. In the nature of the case, it must be in the\r\nhighest degree pernicious. The testimony of _Mr. Douglass_, on this\r\npoint, is sustained by a cloud of witnesses, whose veracity is\r\nunimpeachable. \xe2\x80\x9cA slaveholder\xe2\x80\x99s profession of Christianity is a\r\npalpable imposture. He is a felon of the highest grade. He is a\r\nman-stealer. It is of no importance what you put in the other scale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReader! are you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose, or on\r\nthe side of their down-trodden victims? If with the former, then are\r\nyou the foe of God and man. If with the latter, what are you prepared\r\nto do and dare in their behalf? Be faithful, be vigilant, be untiring\r\nin your efforts to break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free.\r\nCome what may\xe2\x80\x94cost what it may\xe2\x80\x94inscribe on the banner which you unfurl\r\nto the breeze, as your religious and political motto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNO COMPROMISE\r\nWITH SLAVERY! NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWM. LLOYD GARRISON BOSTON,\r\n\r\n_May_ 1, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n LETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON, _April_ 22, 1845.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend:\r\n\r\nYou remember the old fable of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man and the Lion,\xe2\x80\x9d where the lion\r\ncomplained that he should not be so misrepresented \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the lions\r\nwrote history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am glad the time has come when the \xe2\x80\x9clions write history.\xe2\x80\x9d We have\r\nbeen left long enough to gather the character of slavery from the\r\ninvoluntary evidence of the masters. One might, indeed, rest\r\nsufficiently satisfied with what, it is evident, must be, in general,\r\nthe results of such a relation, without seeking farther to find whether\r\nthey have followed in every instance. Indeed, those who stare at the\r\nhalf-peck of corn a week, and love to count the lashes on the slave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback, are seldom the \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d out of which reformers and abolitionists\r\nare to be made. I remember that, in 1838, many were waiting for the\r\nresults of the West India experiment, before they could come into our\r\nranks. Those \xe2\x80\x9cresults\xe2\x80\x9d have come long ago; but, alas! few of that\r\nnumber have come with them, as converts. A man must be disposed to\r\njudge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the\r\nproduce of sugar,\xe2\x80\x94and to hate slavery for other reasons than because it\r\nstarves men and whips women,\xe2\x80\x94before he is ready to lay the first stone\r\nof his anti-slavery life.\r\n\r\nI was glad to learn, in your story, how early the most neglected of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s children waken to a sense of their rights, and of the injustice\r\ndone them. Experience is a keen teacher; and long before you had\r\nmastered your A B C, or knew where the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite sails\xe2\x80\x9d of the Chesapeake\r\nwere bound, you began, I see, to gauge the wretchedness of the slave,\r\nnot by his hunger and want, not by his lashes and toil, but by the\r\ncruel and blighting death which gathers over his soul.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this, there is one circumstance which makes your\r\nrecollections peculiarly valuable, and renders your early insight the\r\nmore remarkable. You come from that part of the country where we are\r\ntold slavery appears with its fairest features. Let us hear, then, what\r\nit is at its best estate\xe2\x80\x94gaze on its bright side, if it has one; and\r\nthen imagination may task her powers to add dark lines to the picture,\r\nas she travels southward to that (for the colored man) Valley of the\r\nShadow of Death, where the Mississippi sweeps along.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have known you long, and can put the most entire confidence\r\nin your truth, candor, and sincerity. Every one who has heard you speak\r\nhas felt, and, I am confident, every one who reads your book will feel,\r\npersuaded that you give them a fair specimen of the whole truth. No\r\none-sided portrait,\xe2\x80\x94no wholesale complaints,\xe2\x80\x94but strict justice done,\r\nwhenever individual kindliness has neutralized, for a moment, the\r\ndeadly system with which it was strangely allied. You have been with\r\nus, too, some years, and can fairly compare the twilight of rights,\r\nwhich your race enjoy at the North, with that \xe2\x80\x9cnoon of night\xe2\x80\x9d under\r\nwhich they labor south of Mason and Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s line. Tell us whether,\r\nafter all, the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than\r\nthe pampered slave of the rice swamps!\r\n\r\nIn reading your life, no one can say that we have unfairly picked out\r\nsome rare specimens of cruelty. We know that the bitter drops, which\r\neven you have drained from the cup, are no incidental aggravations, no\r\nindividual ills, but such as must mingle always and necessarily in the\r\nlot of every slave. They are the essential ingredients, not the\r\noccasional results, of the system.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I shall read your book with trembling for you. Some years\r\nago, when you were beginning to tell me your real name and birthplace,\r\nyou may remember I stopped you, and preferred to remain ignorant of\r\nall. With the exception of a vague description, so I continued, till\r\nthe other day, when you read me your memoirs. I hardly knew, at the\r\ntime, whether to thank you or not for the sight of them, when I\r\nreflected that it was still dangerous, in Massachusetts, for honest men\r\nto tell their names! They say the fathers, in 1776, signed the\r\nDeclaration of Independence with the halter about their necks. You,\r\ntoo, publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassing you\r\naround. In all the broad lands which the Constitution of the United\r\nStates overshadows, there is no single spot,\xe2\x80\x94however narrow or\r\ndesolate,\xe2\x80\x94where a fugitive slave can plant himself and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d The whole armory of Northern Law has no shield for you. I am\r\nfree to say that, in your place, I should throw the MS. into the fire.\r\n\r\nYou, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, endeared as you are to so\r\nmany warm hearts by rare gifts, and a still rarer devotion of them to\r\nthe service of others. But it will be owing only to your labors, and\r\nthe fearless efforts of those who, trampling the laws and Constitution\r\nof the country under their feet, are determined that they will \xe2\x80\x9chide\r\nthe outcast,\xe2\x80\x9d and that their hearths shall be, spite of the law, an\r\nasylum for the oppressed, if, some time or other, the humblest may\r\nstand in our streets, and bear witness in safety against the cruelties\r\nof which he has been the victim.\r\n\r\nYet it is sad to think, that these very throbbing hearts which welcome\r\nyour story, and form your best safeguard in telling it, are all beating\r\ncontrary to the \xe2\x80\x9cstatute in such case made and provided.\xe2\x80\x9d Go on, my\r\ndear friend, till you, and those who, like you, have been saved, so as\r\nby fire, from the dark prison-house, shall stereotype these free,\r\nillegal pulses into statutes; and New England, cutting loose from a\r\nblood-stained Union, shall glory in being the house of refuge for the\r\noppressed,\xe2\x80\x94till we no longer merely \xe2\x80\x9c_hide_ the outcast,\xe2\x80\x9d or make a\r\nmerit of standing idly by while he is hunted in our midst; but,\r\nconsecrating anew the soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the\r\noppressed, proclaim our _welcome_ to the slave so loudly, that the\r\ntones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas, and make the\r\nbroken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nGod speed the day!\r\n_Till then, and ever,_\r\nYours truly,\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n FREDERICK DOUGLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass was born in slavery as Frederick Augustus Washington\r\nBailey near Easton in Talbot County, Maryland. He was not sure of the\r\nexact year of his birth, but he knew that it was 1817 or 1818. As a\r\nyoung boy he was sent to Baltimore, to be a house servant, where he\r\nlearned to read and write, with the assistance of his master\xe2\x80\x99s wife. In\r\n1838 he escaped from slavery and went to New York City, where he\r\nmarried Anna Murray, a free colored woman whom he had met in Baltimore.\r\nSoon thereafter he changed his name to Frederick Douglass. In 1841 he\r\naddressed a convention of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in\r\nNantucket and so greatly impressed the group that they immediately\r\nemployed him as an agent. He was such an impressive orator that\r\nnumerous persons doubted if he had ever been a slave, so he wrote\r\n_Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass_. During the Civil War he\r\nassisted in the recruiting of colored men for the 54th and 55th\r\nMassachusetts Regiments and consistently argued for the emancipation of\r\nslaves. After the war he was active in securing and protecting the\r\nrights of the freemen. In his later years, at different times, he was\r\nsecretary of the Santo Domingo Commission, marshall and recorder of\r\ndeeds of the District of Columbia, and United States Minister to Haiti.\r\nHis other autobiographical works are _My Bondage And My Freedom_ and\r\n_Life And Times Of Frederick Douglass_, published in 1855 and 1881\r\nrespectively. He died in 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from\r\nEaston, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my\r\nage, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the\r\nlarger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know\r\nof theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to\r\nkeep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a\r\nslave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it\r\nthan planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or\r\nfall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of\r\nunhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell\r\ntheir ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same\r\nprivilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master\r\nconcerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave\r\nimproper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. The\r\nnearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and\r\ntwenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say,\r\nsome time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.\r\n\r\nMy mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and\r\nBetsey Bailey, both colored, and quite dark. My mother was of a darker\r\ncomplexion than either my grandmother or grandfather.\r\n\r\nMy father was a white man. He was admitted to be such by all I ever\r\nheard speak of my parentage. The opinion was also whispered that my\r\nmaster was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know\r\nnothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me. My mother and I\r\nwere separated when I was but an infant\xe2\x80\x94before I knew her as my mother.\r\nIt is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away,\r\nto part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently,\r\nbefore the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken\r\nfrom it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and\r\nthe child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field\r\nlabor. For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to\r\nhinder the development of the child\xe2\x80\x99s affection toward its mother, and\r\nto blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child.\r\nThis is the inevitable result.\r\n\r\nI never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five\r\ntimes in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration,\r\nand at night. She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve\r\nmiles from my home. She made her journeys to see me in the night,\r\ntravelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work. She was a field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of not\r\nbeing in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has special permission\r\nfrom his or her master to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94a permission which they seldom\r\nget, and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a\r\nkind master. I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light\r\nof day. She was with me in the night. She would lie down with me, and\r\nget me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone. Very little\r\ncommunication ever took place between us. Death soon ended what little\r\nwe could have while she lived, and with it her hardships and suffering.\r\nShe died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master\xe2\x80\x99s farms,\r\nnear Lee\xe2\x80\x99s Mill. I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at\r\nher death, or burial. She was gone long before I knew any thing about\r\nit. Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing\r\npresence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her\r\ndeath with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the\r\ndeath of a stranger.\r\n\r\nCalled thus suddenly away, she left me without the slightest intimation\r\nof who my father was. The whisper that my master was my father, may or\r\nmay not be true; and, true or false, it is of but little consequence to\r\nmy purpose whilst the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that\r\nslaveholders have ordained, and by law established, that the children\r\nof slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their\r\nmothers; and this is done too obviously to administer to their own\r\nlusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as\r\nwell as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder,\r\nin cases not a few, sustains to his slaves the double relation of\r\nmaster and father.\r\n\r\nI know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves\r\ninvariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with,\r\nthan others. They are, in the first place, a constant offence to their\r\nmistress. She is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom\r\ndo any thing to please her; she is never better pleased than when she\r\nsees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of\r\nshowing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his\r\nblack slaves. The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of\r\nhis slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and,\r\ncruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own\r\nchildren to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity\r\nfor him to do so; for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them\r\nhimself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of\r\nbut few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to\r\nhis naked back; and if he lisp one word of disapproval, it is set down\r\nto his parental partiality, and only makes a bad matter worse, both for\r\nhimself and the slave whom he would protect and defend.\r\n\r\nEvery year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves. It was\r\ndoubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great\r\nstatesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the\r\ninevitable laws of population. Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled\r\nor not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of\r\npeople are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from\r\nthose originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their\r\nincrease do no other good, it will do away the force of the argument,\r\nthat God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right. If the\r\nlineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is\r\ncertain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural; for\r\nthousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe\r\ntheir existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequently\r\ntheir own masters.\r\n\r\nI have had two masters. My first master\xe2\x80\x99s name was Anthony. I do not\r\nremember his first name. He was generally called Captain Anthony\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntitle which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the\r\nChesapeake Bay. He was not considered a rich slaveholder. He owned two\r\nor three farms, and about thirty slaves. His farms and slaves were\r\nunder the care of an overseer. The overseer\xe2\x80\x99s name was Plummer. Mr.\r\nPlummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage\r\nmonster. He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel. I have\r\nknown him to cut and slash the women\xe2\x80\x99s heads so horribly, that even\r\nmaster would be enraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him\r\nif he did not mind himself. Master, however, was not a humane\r\nslaveholder. It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an\r\noverseer to affect him. He was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of\r\nslaveholding. He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping\r\na slave. I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most\r\nheart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to\r\na joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered\r\nwith blood. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim,\r\nseemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder she\r\nscreamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there\r\nhe whipped longest. He would whip her to make her scream, and whip her\r\nto make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he cease to\r\nswing the blood-clotted cowskin. I remember the first time I ever\r\nwitnessed this horrible exhibition. I was quite a child, but I well\r\nremember it. I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing. It\r\nwas the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed\r\nto be a witness and a participant. It struck me with awful force. It\r\nwas the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery,\r\nthrough which I was about to pass. It was a most terrible spectacle. I\r\nwish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old\r\nmaster, and under the following circumstances. Aunt Hester went out one\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x94where or for what I do not know,\xe2\x80\x94and happened to be absent when\r\nmy master desired her presence. He had ordered her not to go out\r\nevenings, and warned her that she must never let him catch her in\r\ncompany with a young man, who was paying attention to her belonging to\r\nColonel Lloyd. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s name was Ned Roberts, generally called\r\nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s Ned. Why master was so careful of her, may be safely left to\r\nconjecture. She was a woman of noble form, and of graceful proportions,\r\nhaving very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personal appearance,\r\namong the colored or white women of our neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out, but had\r\nbeen found in company with Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s Ned; which circumstance, I found,\r\nfrom what he said while whipping her, was the chief offence. Had he\r\nbeen a man of pure morals himself, he might have been thought\r\ninterested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew\r\nhim will not suspect him of any such virtue. Before he commenced\r\nwhipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped her\r\nfrom neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely\r\nnaked. He then told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same\r\ntime a d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d b\xe2\x80\x94-h. After crossing her hands, he tied them with a strong\r\nrope, and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in\r\nfor the purpose. He made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to\r\nthe hook. She now stood fair for his infernal purpose. Her arms were\r\nstretched up at their full length, so that she stood upon the ends of\r\nher toes. He then said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, you d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d b\xe2\x80\x94-h, I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn you how\r\nto disobey my orders!\xe2\x80\x9d and after rolling up his sleeves, he commenced\r\nto lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood (amid\r\nheart-rending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came\r\ndripping to the floor. I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the\r\nsight, that I hid myself in a closet, and dared not venture out till\r\nlong after the bloody transaction was over. I expected it would be my\r\nturn next. It was all new to me. I had never seen any thing like it\r\nbefore. I had always lived with my grandmother on the outskirts of the\r\nplantation, where she was put to raise the children of the younger\r\nwomen. I had therefore been, until now, out of the way of the bloody\r\nscenes that often occurred on the plantation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nMy master\xe2\x80\x99s family consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; one\r\ndaughter, Lucretia, and her husband, Captain Thomas Auld. They lived in\r\none house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd. My master\r\nwas Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s clerk and superintendent. He was what might be\r\ncalled the overseer of the overseers. I spent two years of childhood on\r\nthis plantation in my old master\xe2\x80\x99s family. It was here that I witnessed\r\nthe bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and as I received\r\nmy first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I will give some\r\ndescription of it, and of slavery as it there existed. The plantation\r\nis about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is\r\nsituated on the border of Miles River. The principal products raised\r\nupon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat. These were raised in great\r\nabundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms\r\nbelonging to him, he was able to keep in almost constant employment a\r\nlarge sloop, in carrying them to market at Baltimore. This sloop was\r\nnamed Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s daughters. My\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of the vessel; she was\r\notherwise manned by the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s own slaves. Their names were Peter,\r\nIsaac, Rich, and Jake. These were esteemed very highly by the other\r\nslaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for\r\nit was no small affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nColonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home\r\nplantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms\r\nbelonging to him. The names of the farms nearest to the home plantation\r\nwere Wye Town and New Design. \xe2\x80\x9cWye Town\xe2\x80\x9d was under the overseership of\r\na man named Noah Willis. New Design was under the overseership of a Mr.\r\nTownsend. The overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms,\r\nnumbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers\r\nof the home plantation. This was the great business place. It was the\r\nseat of government for the whole twenty farms. All disputes among the\r\noverseers were settled here. If a slave was convicted of any high\r\nmisdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run\r\naway, he was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board\r\nthe sloop, carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk, or some\r\nother slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining.\r\n\r\nHere, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly\r\nallowance of food, and their yearly clothing. The men and women slaves\r\nreceived, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or\r\nits equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal. Their yearly\r\nclothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts, one pair of linen\r\ntrousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter,\r\nmade of coarse negro cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of\r\nshoes; the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars.\r\nThe allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers, or the\r\nold women having the care of them. The children unable to work in the\r\nfield had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to\r\nthem; their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year.\r\nWhen these failed them, they went naked until the next allowance-day.\r\nChildren from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked,\r\nmight be seen at all seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nThere were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be\r\nconsidered such, and none but the men and women had these. This,\r\nhowever, is not considered a very great privation. They find less\r\ndifficulty from the want of beds, than from the want of time to sleep;\r\nfor when their day\xe2\x80\x99s work in the field is done, the most of them having\r\ntheir washing, mending, and cooking to do, and having few or none of\r\nthe ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their\r\nsleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day;\r\nand when this is done, old and young, male and female, married and\r\nsingle, drop down side by side, on one common bed,\xe2\x80\x94the cold, damp\r\nfloor,\xe2\x80\x94each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets;\r\nand here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorn. At the sound of this, all must rise, and be off to the field.\r\nThere must be no halting; every one must be at his or her post; and woe\r\nbetides them who hear not this morning summons to the field; for if\r\nthey are not awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the sense of\r\nfeeling: no age nor sex finds any favor. Mr. Severe, the overseer, used\r\nto stand by the door of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick\r\nand heavy cowskin, ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not\r\nto hear, or, from any other cause, was prevented from being ready to\r\nstart for the field at the sound of the horn.\r\n\r\nMr. Severe was rightly named: he was a cruel man. I have seen him whip\r\na woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at the time; and this,\r\ntoo, in the midst of her crying children, pleading for their mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelease. He seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendish\r\nbarbarity. Added to his cruelty, he was a profane swearer. It was\r\nenough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to\r\nhear him talk. Scarce a sentence escaped him but that was commenced or\r\nconcluded by some horrid oath. The field was the place to witness his\r\ncruelty and profanity. His presence made it both the field of blood and\r\nof blasphemy. From the rising till the going down of the sun, he was\r\ncursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field,\r\nin the most frightful manner. His career was short. He died very soon\r\nafter I went to Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s; and he died as he lived, uttering,\r\nwith his dying groans, bitter curses and horrid oaths. His death was\r\nregarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence.\r\n\r\nMr. Severe\xe2\x80\x99s place was filled by a Mr. Hopkins. He was a very different\r\nman. He was less cruel, less profane, and made less noise, than Mr.\r\nSevere. His course was characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations\r\nof cruelty. He whipped, but seemed to take no pleasure in it. He was\r\ncalled by the slaves a good overseer.\r\n\r\nThe home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country\r\nvillage. All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed\r\nhere. The shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting,\r\ncoopering, weaving, and grain-grinding, were all performed by the\r\nslaves on the home plantation. The whole place wore a business-like\r\naspect very unlike the neighboring farms. The number of houses, too,\r\nconspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms. It was\r\ncalled by the slaves the _Great House Farm._ Few privileges were\r\nesteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being\r\nselected to do errands at the Great House Farm. It was associated in\r\ntheir minds with greatness. A representative could not be prouder of\r\nhis election to a seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of\r\nthe out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House\r\nFarm. They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them\r\nby their overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant\r\ndesire to be out of the field from under the driver\xe2\x80\x99s lash, that they\r\nesteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for. He was\r\ncalled the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor\r\nconferred upon him the most frequently. The competitors for this office\r\nsought as diligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers\r\nin the political parties seek to please and deceive the people. The\r\nsame traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s slaves, as\r\nare seen in the slaves of the political parties.\r\n\r\nThe slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly\r\nallowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly\r\nenthusiastic. While on their way, they would make the dense old woods,\r\nfor miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once\r\nthe highest joy and the deepest sadness. They would compose and sing as\r\nthey went along, consulting neither time nor tune. The thought that\r\ncame up, came out\xe2\x80\x94if not in the word, in the sound;\xe2\x80\x94and as frequently\r\nin the one as in the other. They would sometimes sing the most pathetic\r\nsentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment\r\nin the most pathetic tone. Into all of their songs they would manage to\r\nweave something of the Great House Farm. Especially would they do this,\r\nwhen leaving home. They would then sing most exultingly the following\r\nwords:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away to the Great House Farm!\r\nO, yea! O, yea! O!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem\r\nunmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to\r\nthemselves. I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those\r\nsongs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character\r\nof slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the\r\nsubject could do.\r\n\r\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and\r\napparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I\r\nneither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a\r\ntale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension;\r\nthey were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and\r\ncomplaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone\r\nwas a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance\r\nfrom chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my\r\nspirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found\r\nmyself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs,\r\neven now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an\r\nexpression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those\r\nsongs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing\r\ncharacter of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those\r\nsongs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my\r\nsympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed\r\nwith the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine\r\nwoods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall\r\npass through the chambers of his soul,\xe2\x80\x94and if he is not thus impressed,\r\nit will only be because \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no flesh in his obdurate heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to\r\nfind persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence\r\nof their contentment and happiness. It is impossible to conceive of a\r\ngreater mistake. Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. The songs\r\nof the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by\r\nthem, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. At least, such\r\nis my experience. I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to\r\nexpress my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike\r\nuncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery. The singing of a man cast\r\naway upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as\r\nevidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the\r\nsongs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded\r\nalmost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener,\r\n(Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Durmond.) This garden was probably the greatest attraction of\r\nthe place. During the summer months, people came from far and near\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nBaltimore, Easton, and Annapolis\xe2\x80\x94to see it. It abounded in fruits of\r\nalmost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the\r\ndelicate orange of the south. This garden was not the least source of\r\ntrouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation\r\nto the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to\r\nthe colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it.\r\nScarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to\r\ntake the lash for stealing fruit. The colonel had to resort to all\r\nkinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden. The last and\r\nmost successful one was that of tarring his fence all around; after\r\nwhich, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was\r\ndeemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had\r\ntried to get in. In either case, he was severely whipped by the chief\r\ngardener. This plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as\r\nof the lash. They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching _tar_\r\nwithout being defiled.\r\n\r\nThe colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. His stable and\r\ncarriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city\r\nlivery establishments. His horses were of the finest form and noblest\r\nblood. His carriage-house contained three splendid coaches, three or\r\nfour gigs, besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nThis establishment was under the care of two slaves\xe2\x80\x94old Barney and\r\nyoung Barney\xe2\x80\x94father and son. To attend to this establishment was their\r\nsole work. But it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing\r\nwas Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses.\r\nThe slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited\r\nupon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest\r\npunishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected\r\nany want of attention to his horses\xe2\x80\x94a supposition which he frequently\r\nindulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young\r\nBarney a very trying one. They never knew when they were safe from\r\npunishment. They were frequently whipped when least deserving, and\r\nescaped whipping when most deserving it. Every thing depended upon the\r\nlooks of the horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s own mind when his\r\nhorses were brought to him for use. If a horse did not move fast\r\nenough, or hold his head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his\r\nkeepers. It was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the\r\nvarious complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for\r\nuse. \xe2\x80\x9cThis horse has not had proper attention. He has not been\r\nsufficiently rubbed and curried, or he has not been properly fed; his\r\nfood was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or too late; he was too\r\nhot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he\r\nhad too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.\xe2\x80\x9d To\r\nall these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never\r\na word. Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave.\r\nWhen he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was\r\nliterally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man\r\nbetween fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down\r\nupon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn\r\nshoulders more than thirty lashes at the time. Colonel Lloyd had three\r\nsons\xe2\x80\x94Edward, Murray, and Daniel,\xe2\x80\x94and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr.\r\nNicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. All of these lived at the Great House Farm,\r\nand enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from\r\nold Barney down to William Wilkes, the coach-driver. I have seen Winder\r\nmake one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance\r\nto be touched with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise great\r\nridges upon his back.\r\n\r\nTo describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to\r\ndescribing the riches of Job. He kept from ten to fifteen\r\nhouse-servants. He was said to own a thousand slaves, and I think this\r\nestimate quite within the truth. Colonel Lloyd owned so many that he\r\ndid not know them when he saw them; nor did all the slaves of the\r\nout-farms know him. It is reported of him, that, while riding along the\r\nroad one day, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual\r\nmanner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the\r\nsouth: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, boy, whom do you belong to?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo Colonel Lloyd,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe slave. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, does the colonel treat you well?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nready reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, does he work you too hard?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t he give you enough to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, he gives me enough, such\r\nas it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel, after ascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the\r\nman also went on about his business, not dreaming that he had been\r\nconversing with his master. He thought, said, and heard nothing more of\r\nthe matter, until two or three weeks afterwards. The poor man was then\r\ninformed by his overseer that, for having found fault with his master,\r\nhe was now to be sold to a Georgia trader. He was immediately chained\r\nand handcuffed; and thus, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s warning, he was snatched\r\naway, and forever sundered, from his family and friends, by a hand more\r\nunrelenting than death. This is the penalty of telling the truth, of\r\ntelling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions.\r\n\r\nIt is partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquired\r\nof as to their condition and the character of their masters, almost\r\nuniversally say they are contented, and that their masters are kind.\r\nThe slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves,\r\nto ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition. The\r\nfrequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the\r\nmaxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They suppress the truth\r\nrather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing prove\r\nthemselves a part of the human family. If they have any thing to say of\r\ntheir masters, it is generally in their masters\xe2\x80\x99 favor, especially when\r\nspeaking to an untried man. I have been frequently asked, when a slave,\r\nif I had a kind master, and do not remember ever to have given a\r\nnegative answer; nor did I, in pursuing this course, consider myself as\r\nuttering what was absolutely false; for I always measured the kindness\r\nof my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders\r\naround us. Moreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibe\r\nprejudices quite common to others. They think their own better than\r\nthat of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice, think\r\ntheir own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and\r\nthis, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is\r\nnot uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves\r\nabout the relative goodness of their masters, each contending for the\r\nsuperior goodness of his own over that of the others. At the very same\r\ntime, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately. It\r\nwas so on our plantation. When Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s slaves met the slaves of\r\nJacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters;\r\nColonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr.\r\nJepson\xe2\x80\x99s slaves that he was the smartest, and most of a man. Colonel\r\nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson.\r\nMr. Jepson\xe2\x80\x99s slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd.\r\nThese quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties,\r\nand those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue.\r\nThey seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was\r\ntransferable to themselves. It was considered as being bad enough to be\r\na slave; but to be a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s slave was deemed a disgrace indeed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins remained but a short time in the office of overseer. Why\r\nhis career was so short, I do not know, but suppose he lacked the\r\nnecessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd. Mr. Hopkins was succeeded by\r\nMr. Austin Gore, a man possessing, in an eminent degree, all those\r\ntraits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate\r\noverseer. Mr. Gore had served Colonel Lloyd, in the capacity of\r\noverseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy of\r\nthe high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm.\r\n\r\nMr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. He was artful, cruel,\r\nand obdurate. He was just the man for such a place, and it was just the\r\nplace for such a man. It afforded scope for the full exercise of all\r\nhis powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it. He was one of\r\nthose who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the\r\npart of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly.\r\nThere must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a\r\nslave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused. Mr. Gore acted\r\nfully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better that a\r\ndozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer\r\nshould be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at\r\nfault.\xe2\x80\x9d No matter how innocent a slave might be\xe2\x80\x94it availed him nothing,\r\nwhen accused by Mr. Gore of any misdemeanor. To be accused was to be\r\nconvicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always\r\nfollowing the other with immutable certainty. To escape punishment was\r\nto escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either,\r\nunder the overseership of Mr. Gore. He was just proud enough to demand\r\nthe most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to\r\ncrouch, himself, at the feet of the master. He was ambitious enough to\r\nbe contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and\r\npersevering enough to reach the height of his ambition. He was cruel\r\nenough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to\r\nthe lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice\r\nof a reproving conscience. He was, of all the overseers, the most\r\ndreaded by the slaves. His presence was painful; his eye flashed\r\nconfusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without\r\nproducing horror and trembling in their ranks.\r\n\r\nMr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no\r\njokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled. His words were in perfect\r\nkeeping with his looks, and his looks were in perfect keeping with his\r\nwords. Overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word, even with the\r\nslaves; not so with Mr. Gore. He spoke but to command, and commanded\r\nbut to be obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words, and bountifully\r\nwith his whip, never using the former where the latter would answer as\r\nwell. When he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and\r\nfeared no consequences. He did nothing reluctantly, no matter how\r\ndisagreeable; always at his post, never inconsistent. He never promised\r\nbut to fulfil. He was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness\r\nand stone-like coolness.\r\n\r\nHis savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with\r\nwhich he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves\r\nunder his charge. Mr. Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel\r\nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s slaves, by the name of Demby. He had given Demby but few\r\nstripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, he ran and plunged himself\r\ninto a creek, and stood there at the depth of his shoulders, refusing\r\nto come out. Mr. Gore told him that he would give him three calls, and\r\nthat, if he did not come out at the third call, he would shoot him. The\r\nfirst call was given. Demby made no response, but stood his ground. The\r\nsecond and third calls were given with the same result. Mr. Gore then,\r\nwithout consultation or deliberation with any one, not even giving\r\nDemby an additional call, raised his musket to his face, taking deadly\r\naim at his standing victim, and in an instant poor Demby was no more.\r\nHis mangled body sank out of sight, and blood and brains marked the\r\nwater where he had stood.\r\n\r\nA thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation,\r\nexcepting Mr. Gore. He alone seemed cool and collected. He was asked by\r\nColonel Lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this extraordinary\r\nexpedient. His reply was, (as well as I can remember,) that Demby had\r\nbecome unmanageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the other\r\nslaves,\xe2\x80\x94one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration\r\non his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and\r\norder upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave refused to be\r\ncorrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy\r\nthe example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves,\r\nand the enslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore\xe2\x80\x99s defence was satisfactory.\r\nHe was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation.\r\nHis fame as an overseer went abroad. His horrid crime was not even\r\nsubmitted to judicial investigation. It was committed in the presence\r\nof slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor\r\ntestify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the\r\nbloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and\r\nuncensured by the community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived in St.\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s, Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is\r\nstill alive, he very probably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as\r\nhe was then, as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his\r\nguilty soul had not been stained with his brother\xe2\x80\x99s blood.\r\n\r\nI speak advisedly when I say this,\xe2\x80\x94that killing a slave, or any colored\r\nperson, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either\r\nby the courts or the community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, of St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nkilled two slaves, one of whom he killed with a hatchet, by knocking\r\nhis brains out. He used to boast of the commission of the awful and\r\nbloody deed. I have heard him do so laughingly, saying, among other\r\nthings, that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company,\r\nand that when others would do as much as he had done, we should be\r\nrelieved of \xe2\x80\x9cthe d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d niggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, living but a short distance from where I\r\nused to live, murdered my wife\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, a young girl between fifteen\r\nand sixteen years of age, mangling her person in the most horrible\r\nmanner, breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick, so that the poor\r\ngirl expired in a few hours afterward. She was immediately buried, but\r\nhad not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken\r\nup and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her\r\ndeath by severe beating. The offence for which this girl was thus\r\nmurdered was this:\xe2\x80\x94She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbaby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She,\r\nhaving lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the\r\ncrying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks. Mrs. Hicks, finding\r\nthe girl slow to move, jumped from her bed, seized an oak stick of wood\r\nby the fireplace, and with it broke the girl\xe2\x80\x99s nose and breastbone, and\r\nthus ended her life. I will not say that this most horrid murder\r\nproduced no sensation in the community. It did produce sensation, but\r\nnot enough to bring the murderess to punishment. There was a warrant\r\nissued for her arrest, but it was never served. Thus she escaped not\r\nonly punishment, but even the pain of being arraigned before a court\r\nfor her horrid crime.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on\r\nColonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation, I will briefly narrate another, which\r\noccurred about the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr. Gore.\r\n\r\nColonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their\r\nnights and Sundays in fishing for oysters, and in this way made up the\r\ndeficiency of their scanty allowance. An old man belonging to Colonel\r\nLloyd, while thus engaged, happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel\r\nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s, and on the premises of Mr. Beal Bondly. At this trespass, Mr.\r\nBondly took offence, and with his musket came down to the shore, and\r\nblew its deadly contents into the poor old man.\r\n\r\nMr. Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day, whether to pay\r\nhim for his property, or to justify himself in what he had done, I know\r\nnot. At any rate, this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up.\r\nThere was very little said about it at all, and nothing done. It was a\r\ncommon saying, even among little white boys, that it was worth a\r\nhalf-cent to kill a \xe2\x80\x9cnigger,\xe2\x80\x9d and a half-cent to bury one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation, it\r\nwas very similar to that of the other slave children. I was not old\r\nenough to work in the field, and there being little else than field\r\nwork to do, I had a great deal of leisure time. The most I had to do\r\nwas to drive up the cows at evening, keep the fowls out of the garden,\r\nkeep the front yard clean, and run of errands for my old master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Lucretia Auld. The most of my leisure time I spent in\r\nhelping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds, after he had shot\r\nthem. My connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me. He\r\nbecame quite attached to me, and was a sort of protector of me. He\r\nwould not allow the older boys to impose upon me, and would divide his\r\ncakes with me.\r\n\r\nI was seldom whipped by my old master, and suffered little from any\r\nthing else than hunger and cold. I suffered much from hunger, but much\r\nmore from cold. In hottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost\r\nnaked\xe2\x80\x94no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a\r\ncoarse tow linen shirt, reaching only to my knees. I had no bed. I must\r\nhave perished with cold, but that, the coldest nights, I used to steal\r\na bag which was used for carrying corn to the mill. I would crawl into\r\nthis bag, and there sleep on the cold, damp, clay floor, with my head\r\nin and feet out. My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the\r\npen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes.\r\n\r\nWe were not regularly allowanced. Our food was coarse corn meal boiled.\r\nThis was called _mush_. It was put into a large wooden tray or trough,\r\nand set down upon the ground. The children were then called, like so\r\nmany pigs, and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush;\r\nsome with oyster-shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked\r\nhands, and none with spoons. He that ate fastest got most; he that was\r\nstrongest secured the best place; and few left the trough satisfied.\r\n\r\nI was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel\r\nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation. I left it with joy. I shall never forget the\r\necstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master\r\n(Anthony) had determined to let me go to Baltimore, to live with Mr.\r\nHugh Auld, brother to my old master\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld.\r\nI received this information about three days before my departure. They\r\nwere three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed. I spent the most part\r\nof all these three days in the creek, washing off the plantation scurf,\r\nand preparing myself for my departure.\r\n\r\nThe pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own. I\r\nspent the time in washing, not so much because I wished to, but because\r\nMrs. Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and\r\nknees before I could go to Baltimore; for the people in Baltimore were\r\nvery cleanly, and would laugh at me if I looked dirty. Besides, she was\r\ngoing to give me a pair of trousers, which I should not put on unless I\r\ngot all the dirt off me. The thought of owning a pair of trousers was\r\ngreat indeed! It was almost a sufficient motive, not only to make me\r\ntake off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange, but the skin\r\nitself. I went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with\r\nthe hope of reward.\r\n\r\nThe ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all\r\nsuspended in my case. I found no severe trial in my departure. My home\r\nwas charmless; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I could not\r\nfeel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by\r\nstaying. My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I\r\nseldom saw her. I had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the\r\nsame house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had\r\nwell nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories. I\r\nlooked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I\r\nshould relish less than the one which I was leaving. If, however, I\r\nfound in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had\r\nthe consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by\r\nstaying. Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of\r\nmy old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred\r\nmy ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I\r\nhad something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the\r\nproverb, that \xe2\x80\x9cbeing hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural\r\ndeath in Ireland.\xe2\x80\x9d I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. Cousin\r\nTom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by\r\nhis eloquent description of the place. I could never point out any\r\nthing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that\r\nhe had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and\r\nstrength, the object which I pointed out to him. Even the Great House\r\nitself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in\r\nBaltimore. So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of\r\nit would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should\r\nsustain by the exchange. I left without a regret, and with the highest\r\nhopes of future happiness.\r\n\r\nWe sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning. I\r\nremember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge\r\nof the days of the month, nor the months of the year. On setting sail,\r\nI walked aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation what I hoped would\r\nbe the last look. I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and\r\nthere spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead, interesting\r\nmyself in what was in the distance rather than in things near by or\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of that day, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the\r\nState. We stopped but a few moments, so that I had no time to go on\r\nshore. It was the first large town that I had ever seen, and though it\r\nwould look small compared with some of our New England factory\r\nvillages, I thought it a wonderful place for its size\xe2\x80\x94more imposing\r\neven than the Great House Farm!\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning, landing at Smith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWharf, not far from Bowley\xe2\x80\x99s Wharf. We had on board the sloop a large\r\nflock of sheep; and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse\r\nof Mr. Curtis on Louden Slater\xe2\x80\x99s Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of\r\nthe hands belonging on board of the sloop, to my new home in Alliciana\r\nStreet, near Mr. Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s ship-yard, on Fells Point.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Auld were both at home, and met me at the door with their\r\nlittle son Thomas, to take care of whom I had been given. And here I\r\nsaw what I had never seen before; it was a white face beaming with the\r\nmost kindly emotions; it was the face of my new mistress, Sophia Auld.\r\nI wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I\r\nbeheld it. It was a new and strange sight to me, brightening up my\r\npathway with the light of happiness. Little Thomas was told, there was\r\nhis Freddy,\xe2\x80\x94and I was told to take care of little Thomas; and thus I\r\nentered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nI look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation as one of the\r\nmost interesting events of my life. It is possible, and even quite\r\nprobable, that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that\r\nplantation to Baltimore, I should have to-day, instead of being here\r\nseated by my own table, in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness\r\nof home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the galling chains of\r\nslavery. Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the\r\ngateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. I have ever regarded it as\r\nthe first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever\r\nsince attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. I regarded\r\nthe selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable. There were a\r\nnumber of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation\r\nto Baltimore. There were those younger, those older, and those of the\r\nsame age. I was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last,\r\nand only choice.\r\n\r\nI may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this\r\nevent as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor. But\r\nI should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I\r\nsuppressed the opinion. I prefer to be true to myself, even at the\r\nhazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false,\r\nand incur my own abhorrence. From my earliest recollection, I date the\r\nentertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be\r\nable to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hours of my\r\ncareer in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope\r\ndeparted not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me\r\nthrough the gloom. This good spirit was from God, and to him I offer\r\nthanksgiving and praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMy new mistress proved to be all she appeared when I first met her at\r\nthe door,\xe2\x80\x94a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings. She had\r\nnever had a slave under her control previously to myself, and prior to\r\nher marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry for a living.\r\nShe was by trade a weaver; and by constant application to her business,\r\nshe had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and\r\ndehumanizing effects of slavery. I was utterly astonished at her\r\ngoodness. I scarcely knew how to behave towards her. She was entirely\r\nunlike any other white woman I had ever seen. I could not approach her\r\nas I was accustomed to approach other white ladies. My early\r\ninstruction was all out of place. The crouching servility, usually so\r\nacceptable a quality in a slave, did not answer when manifested toward\r\nher. Her favor was not gained by it; she seemed to be disturbed by it.\r\nShe did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in\r\nthe face. The meanest slave was put fully at ease in her presence, and\r\nnone left without feeling better for having seen her. Her face was made\r\nof heavenly smiles, and her voice of tranquil music.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! this kind heart had but a short time to remain such. The\r\nfatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her hands, and soon\r\ncommenced its infernal work. That cheerful eye, under the influence of\r\nslavery, soon became red with rage; that voice, made all of sweet\r\naccord, changed to one of harsh and horrid discord; and that angelic\r\nface gave place to that of a demon.\r\n\r\nVery soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she very kindly\r\ncommenced to teach me the A, B, C. After I had learned this, she\r\nassisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just\r\nat this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and\r\nat once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among\r\nother things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave\r\nto read. To use his own words, further, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you give a nigger\r\nan inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x94to do as he is told to do. Learning would _spoil_ the best\r\nnigger in the world. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you teach that nigger (speaking\r\nof myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever\r\nunfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of\r\nno value to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a\r\ngreat deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d These\r\nwords sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay\r\nslumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought.\r\nIt was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious\r\nthings, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but\r\nstruggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most\r\nperplexing difficulty\xe2\x80\x94to wit, the white man\xe2\x80\x99s power to enslave the\r\nblack man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From\r\nthat moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was\r\njust what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected\r\nit. Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind\r\nmistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the\r\nmerest accident, I had gained from my master. Though conscious of the\r\ndifficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and\r\na fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read. The\r\nvery decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife\r\nwith the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince\r\nme that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave\r\nme the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on\r\nthe results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read. What\r\nhe most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most loved, that I most\r\nhated. That which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was\r\nto me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he\r\nso warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me\r\nwith a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owe\r\nalmost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly\r\naid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.\r\n\r\nI had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked\r\ndifference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed\r\nin the country. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave\r\non the plantation. He is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys\r\nprivileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation. There is\r\na vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and\r\ncheck those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the\r\nplantation. He is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity\r\nof his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated\r\nslave. Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation\r\nof being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known\r\nas not giving a slave enough to eat. Every city slaveholder is anxious\r\nto have it known of him, that he feeds his slaves well; and it is due\r\nto them to say, that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat.\r\nThere are, however, some painful exceptions to this rule. Directly\r\nopposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr. Thomas Hamilton. He owned\r\ntwo slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary. Henrietta was about\r\ntwenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of all the\r\nmangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the\r\nmost so. His heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon\r\nthese unmoved. The head, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut\r\nto pieces. I have frequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered\r\nwith festering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do\r\nnot know that her master ever whipped her, but I have been an\r\neye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton. I used to be in Mr.\r\nHamilton\xe2\x80\x99s house nearly every day. Mrs. Hamilton used to sit in a large\r\nchair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by her\r\nside, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the\r\nblood of one of these slaves. The girls seldom passed her without her\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cMove faster, you _black gip!_\xe2\x80\x9d at the same time giving them a\r\nblow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the\r\nblood. She would then say, \xe2\x80\x9cTake that, you _black gip!_\xe2\x80\x9d continuing,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t move faster, I\xe2\x80\x99ll move you!\xe2\x80\x9d Added to the cruel lashings\r\nto which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly\r\nhalf-starved. They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal. I have\r\nseen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the\r\nstreet. So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftener\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9c_pecked_\xe2\x80\x9d than by her name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nI lived in Master Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s family about seven years. During this time, I\r\nsucceeded in learning to read and write. In accomplishing this, I was\r\ncompelled to resort to various stratagems. I had no regular teacher. My\r\nmistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct me, had, in compliance\r\nwith the advice and direction of her husband, not only ceased to\r\ninstruct, but had set her face against my being instructed by any one\r\nelse. It is due, however, to my mistress to say of her, that she did\r\nnot adopt this course of treatment immediately. She at first lacked the\r\ndepravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness. It was at\r\nleast necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of\r\nirresponsible power, to make her equal to the task of treating me as\r\nthough I were a brute.\r\n\r\nMy mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and\r\nin the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live\r\nwith her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat\r\nanother. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem\r\nto perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and\r\nthat for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but\r\ndangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me.\r\nWhen I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman.\r\nThere was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had\r\nbread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every\r\nmourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to\r\ndivest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender\r\nheart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of\r\ntiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her\r\nceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprecepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than\r\nher husband himself. She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as\r\nhe had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to\r\nmake her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to\r\nthink that here lay the danger. I have had her rush at me with a face\r\nmade all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that\r\nfully revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman; and a little\r\nexperience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and\r\nslavery were incompatible with each other.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate room\r\nany considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a\r\nbook, and was at once called to give an account of myself. All this,\r\nhowever, was too late. The first step had been taken. Mistress, in\r\nteaching me the alphabet, had given me the _inch,_ and no precaution\r\ncould prevent me from taking the _ell._\r\n\r\nThe plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful,\r\nwas that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in\r\nthe street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers.\r\nWith their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different\r\nplaces, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of\r\nerrands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my\r\nerrand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used\r\nalso to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house,\r\nand to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this\r\nregard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This\r\nbread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return,\r\nwould give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly\r\ntempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a\r\ntestimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence\r\nforbids;\xe2\x80\x94not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for\r\nit is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this\r\nChristian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that\r\nthey lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s ship-yard.\r\nI used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes\r\nsay to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got\r\nto be men. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, _but I am a\r\nslave for life!_ Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese words used to trouble them; they would express for me the\r\nliveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would\r\noccur by which I might be free.\r\n\r\nI was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being _a slave for\r\nlife_ began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time, I got\r\nhold of a book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Columbian Orator.\xe2\x80\x9d Every opportunity I\r\ngot, I used to read this book. Among much of other interesting matter,\r\nI found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was\r\nrepresented as having run away from his master three times. The\r\ndialogue represented the conversation which took place between them,\r\nwhen the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole\r\nargument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of\r\nwhich was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made to say some very\r\nsmart as well as impressive things in reply to his master\xe2\x80\x94things which\r\nhad the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted\r\nin the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.\r\n\r\nIn the same book, I met with one of Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s mighty speeches on and\r\nin behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to me.\r\nI read them over and over again with unabated interest. They gave\r\ntongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently\r\nflashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral\r\nwhich I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the\r\nconscience of even a slaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was a bold\r\ndenunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights.\r\nThe reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to\r\nmeet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they\r\nrelieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more\r\npainful than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, the more\r\nI was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no\r\nother light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their\r\nhomes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a\r\nstrange land reduced us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest\r\nas well as the most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the\r\nsubject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had\r\npredicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment\r\nand sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I\r\nwould at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than\r\na blessing. It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without\r\nthe remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder\r\nupon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves\r\nfor their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred\r\nthe condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter\r\nwhat, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my\r\ncondition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was\r\npressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or\r\ninanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal\r\nwakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was\r\nheard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to\r\ntorment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without\r\nseeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without\r\nfeeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm,\r\nbreathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.\r\n\r\nI often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself\r\ndead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I\r\nshould have killed myself, or done something for which I should have\r\nbeen killed. While in this state of mind, I was eager to hear any one\r\nspeak of slavery. I was a ready listener. Every little while, I could\r\nhear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I found\r\nwhat the word meant. It was always used in such connections as to make\r\nit an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away and succeeded in\r\ngetting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a barn, or\r\ndid any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of\r\nas the fruit of _abolition._ Hearing the word in this connection very\r\noften, I set about learning what it meant. The dictionary afforded me\r\nlittle or no help. I found it was \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of abolishing;\xe2\x80\x9d but then I\r\ndid not know what was to be abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not\r\ndare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was\r\nsomething they wanted me to know very little about. After a patient\r\nwaiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the\r\nnumber of petitions from the north, praying for the abolition of\r\nslavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave trade between the\r\nStates. From this time I understood the words _abolition_ and\r\n_abolitionist,_ and always drew near when that word was spoken,\r\nexpecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves.\r\nThe light broke in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on the wharf\r\nof Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I\r\nwent, unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came\r\nto me and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nye a slave for life?\xe2\x80\x9d I told him that I was. The good Irishman seemed\r\nto be deeply affected by the statement. He said to the other that it\r\nwas a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for\r\nlife. He said it was a shame to hold me. They both advised me to run\r\naway to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should\r\nbe free. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, and\r\ntreated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might\r\nbe treacherous. White men have been known to encourage slaves to\r\nescape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return them to\r\ntheir masters. I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me\r\nso; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and from that time I\r\nresolved to run away. I looked forward to a time at which it would be\r\nsafe for me to escape. I was too young to think of doing so\r\nimmediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might have\r\noccasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the hope that I\r\nshould one day find a good chance. Meanwhile, I would learn to write.\r\n\r\nThe idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being\r\nin Durgin and Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship\r\ncarpenters, after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready for use,\r\nwrite on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was\r\nintended. When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side, it\r\nwould be marked thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cL.\xe2\x80\x9d When a piece was for the starboard side, it\r\nwould be marked thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cS.\xe2\x80\x9d A piece for the larboard side forward, would\r\nbe marked thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cL. F.\xe2\x80\x9d When a piece was for starboard side forward, it\r\nwould be marked thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cS. F.\xe2\x80\x9d For larboard aft, it would be marked\r\nthus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cL. A.\xe2\x80\x9d For starboard aft, it would be marked thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cS. A.\xe2\x80\x9d I soon\r\nlearned the names of these letters, and for what they were intended\r\nwhen placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard. I immediately\r\ncommenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four\r\nletters named. After that, when I met with any boy who I knew could\r\nwrite, I would tell him I could write as well as he. The next word\r\nwould be, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. Let me see you try it.\xe2\x80\x9d I would then\r\nmake the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask him\r\nto beat that. In this way I got a good many lessons in writing, which\r\nit is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way.\r\nDuring this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, and\r\npavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk. With these, I learned\r\nmainly how to write. I then commenced and continued copying the Italics\r\nin Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Spelling Book, until I could make them all without looking\r\non the book. By this time, my little Master Thomas had gone to school,\r\nand learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books.\r\nThese had been brought home, and shown to some of our near neighbors,\r\nand then laid aside. My mistress used to go to class meeting at the\r\nWilk Street meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take\r\ncare of the house. When left thus, I used to spend the time in writing\r\nin the spaces left in Master Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s copy-book, copying what he had\r\nwritten. I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar\r\nto that of Master Thomas. Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years,\r\nI finally succeeded in learning how to write.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore, my old master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyoungest son Richard died; and in about three years and six months\r\nafter his death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his\r\nson, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate. He died while\r\non a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough. Cut off thus\r\nunexpectedly, he left no will as to the disposal of his property. It\r\nwas therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property, that it\r\nmight be equally divided between Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew. I was\r\nimmediately sent for, to be valued with the other property. Here again\r\nmy feelings rose up in detestation of slavery. I had now a new\r\nconception of my degraded condition. Prior to this, I had become, if\r\nnot insensible to my lot, at least partly so. I left Baltimore with a\r\nyoung heart overborne with sadness, and a soul full of apprehension. I\r\ntook passage with Captain Rowe, in the schooner Wild Cat, and, after a\r\nsail of about twenty-four hours, I found myself near the place of my\r\nbirth. I had now been absent from it almost, if not quite, five years.\r\nI, however, remembered the place very well. I was only about five years\r\nold when I left it, to go and live with my old master on Colonel\r\nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation; so that I was now between ten and eleven years old.\r\n\r\nWe were all ranked together at the valuation. Men and women, old and\r\nyoung, married and single, were ranked with horses, sheep, and swine.\r\nThere were horses and men, cattle and women, pigs and children, all\r\nholding the same rank in the scale of being, and were all subjected to\r\nthe same narrow examination. Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth,\r\nmaids and matrons, had to undergo the same indelicate inspection. At\r\nthis moment, I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing effects of\r\nslavery upon both slave and slaveholder.\r\n\r\nAfter the valuation, then came the division. I have no language to\r\nexpress the high excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us\r\npoor slaves during this time. Our fate for life was now to be decided.\r\nWe had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we\r\nwere ranked. A single word from the white men was enough\xe2\x80\x94against all\r\nour wishes, prayers, and entreaties\xe2\x80\x94to sunder forever the dearest\r\nfriends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings. In\r\naddition to the pain of separation, there was the horrid dread of\r\nfalling into the hands of Master Andrew. He was known to us all as\r\nbeing a most cruel wretch,\xe2\x80\x94a common drunkard, who had, by his reckless\r\nmismanagement and profligate dissipation, already wasted a large\r\nportion of his father\xe2\x80\x99s property. We all felt that we might as well be\r\nsold at once to the Georgia traders, as to pass into his hands; for we\r\nknew that that would be our inevitable condition,\xe2\x80\x94a condition held by\r\nus all in the utmost horror and dread.\r\n\r\nI suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves. I had known what\r\nit was to be kindly treated; they had known nothing of the kind. They\r\nhad seen little or nothing of the world. They were in very deed men and\r\nwomen of sorrow, and acquainted with grief. Their backs had been made\r\nfamiliar with the bloody lash, so that they had become callous; mine\r\nwas yet tender; for while at Baltimore I got few whippings, and few\r\nslaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself; and the\r\nthought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew\xe2\x80\x94a man\r\nwho, but a few days before, to give me a sample of his bloody\r\ndisposition, took my little brother by the throat, threw him on the\r\nground, and with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the\r\nblood gushed from his nose and ears\xe2\x80\x94was well calculated to make me\r\nanxious as to my fate. After he had committed this savage outrage upon\r\nmy brother, he turned to me, and said that was the way he meant to\r\nserve me one of these days,\xe2\x80\x94meaning, I suppose, when I came into his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThanks to a kind Providence, I fell to the portion of Mrs. Lucretia,\r\nand was sent immediately back to Baltimore, to live again in the family\r\nof Master Hugh. Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my\r\ndeparture. It was a glad day to me. I had escaped a worse than lion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njaws. I was absent from Baltimore, for the purpose of valuation and\r\ndivision, just about one month, and it seemed to have been six.\r\n\r\nVery soon after my return to Baltimore, my mistress, Lucretia, died,\r\nleaving her husband and one child, Amanda; and in a very short time\r\nafter her death, Master Andrew died. Now all the property of my old\r\nmaster, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers,\xe2\x80\x94strangers who\r\nhad had nothing to do with accumulating it. Not a slave was left free.\r\nAll remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest. If any one thing\r\nin my experience, more than another, served to deepen my conviction of\r\nthe infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable\r\nloathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor old\r\ngrandmother. She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old\r\nage. She had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his\r\nplantation with slaves; she had become a great grandmother in his\r\nservice. She had rocked him in infancy, attended him in childhood,\r\nserved him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow the\r\ncold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was nevertheless\r\nleft a slave\xe2\x80\x94a slave for life\xe2\x80\x94a slave in the hands of strangers; and in\r\ntheir hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her\r\ngreat-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being\r\ngratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her\r\nown destiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and\r\nfiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having\r\noutlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning\r\nand end of all of them, and her present owners finding she was of but\r\nlittle value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age, and\r\ncomplete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they\r\ntook her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little\r\nmud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting\r\nherself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to\r\ndie! If my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter\r\nloneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children,\r\nthe loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren. They\r\nare, in the language of the slave\xe2\x80\x99s poet, Whittier,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone, gone, sold and gone\r\nTo the rice swamp dank and lone,\r\nWhere the slave-whip ceaseless swings,\r\nWhere the noisome insect stings,\r\nWhere the fever-demon strews\r\nPoison with the falling dews,\r\nWhere the sickly sunbeams glare\r\nThrough the hot and misty air:\xe2\x80\x94\r\nGone, gone, sold and gone\r\nTo the rice swamp dank and lone,\r\nFrom Virginia hills and waters\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWoe is me, my stolen daughters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who\r\nonce sang and danced in her presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in\r\nthe darkness of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices of her\r\nchildren, she hears by day the moans of the dove, and by night the\r\nscreams of the hideous owl. All is gloom. The grave is at the door. And\r\nnow, when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age, when the head\r\ninclines to the feet, when the beginning and ending of human existence\r\nmeet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together\xe2\x80\x94at this\r\ntime, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of that\r\ntenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a\r\ndeclining parent\xe2\x80\x94my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve\r\nchildren, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim\r\nembers. She stands\xe2\x80\x94she sits\xe2\x80\x94she staggers\xe2\x80\x94she falls\xe2\x80\x94she groans\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ndies\xe2\x80\x94and there are none of her children or grandchildren present, to\r\nwipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place\r\nbeneath the sod her fallen remains. Will not a righteous God visit for\r\nthese things?\r\n\r\nIn about two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas\r\nmarried his second wife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton. She was the\r\neldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton. Master now lived in St.\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s. Not long after his marriage, a misunderstanding took place\r\nbetween himself and Master Hugh; and as a means of punishing his\r\nbrother, he took me from him to live with himself at St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHere I underwent another most painful separation. It, however, was not\r\nso severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property; for, during\r\nthis interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his\r\nonce kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and\r\nof slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters\r\nof both; so that, as far as they were concerned, I thought I had little\r\nto lose by the change. But it was not to them that I was attached. It\r\nwas to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest\r\nattachment. I had received many good lessons from them, and was still\r\nreceiving them, and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed. I\r\nwas leaving, too, without the hope of ever being allowed to return.\r\nMaster Thomas had said he would never let me return again. The barrier\r\nbetwixt himself and brother he considered impassable.\r\n\r\nI then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry\r\nout my resolution to run away; for the chances of success are tenfold\r\ngreater from the city than from the country.\r\n\r\nI sailed from Baltimore for St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s in the sloop Amanda, Captain\r\nEdward Dodson. On my passage, I paid particular attention to the\r\ndirection which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia. I found,\r\ninstead of going down, on reaching North Point they went up the bay, in\r\na north-easterly direction. I deemed this knowledge of the utmost\r\nimportance. My determination to run away was again revived. I resolved\r\nto wait only so long as the offering of a favorable opportunity. When\r\nthat came, I was determined to be off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now reached a period of my life when I can give dates. I left\r\nBaltimore, and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nin March, 1832. It was now more than seven years since I lived with him\r\nin the family of my old master, on Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation. We of\r\ncourse were now almost entire strangers to each other. He was to me a\r\nnew master, and I to him a new slave. I was ignorant of his temper and\r\ndisposition; he was equally so of mine. A very short time, however,\r\nbrought us into full acquaintance with each other. I was made\r\nacquainted with his wife not less than with himself. They were well\r\nmatched, being equally mean and cruel. I was now, for the first time\r\nduring a space of more than seven years, made to feel the painful\r\ngnawings of hunger\xe2\x80\x94a something which I had not experienced before since\r\nI left Colonel Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s plantation. It went hard enough with me then,\r\nwhen I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a\r\nsufficiency. It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that which was\r\ngood. I have said Master Thomas was a mean man. He was so. Not to give\r\na slave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development\r\nof meanness even among slaveholders. The rule is, no matter how coarse\r\nthe food, only let there be enough of it. This is the theory; and in\r\nthe part of Maryland from which I came, it is the general\r\npractice,\xe2\x80\x94though there are many exceptions. Master Thomas gave us\r\nenough of neither coarse nor fine food. There were four slaves of us in\r\nthe kitchen\xe2\x80\x94my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and myself; and\r\nwe were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week, and\r\nvery little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables. It was not\r\nenough for us to subsist upon. We were therefore reduced to the\r\nwretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors. This we\r\ndid by begging and stealing, whichever came handy in the time of need,\r\nthe one being considered as legitimate as the other. A great many times\r\nhave we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger, when food in\r\nabundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house, and our pious\r\nmistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and her husband\r\nwould kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basket\r\nand store!\r\n\r\nBad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every\r\nelement of character commanding respect. My master was one of this rare\r\nsort. I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him. The\r\nleading trait in his character was meanness; and if there were any\r\nother element in his nature, it was made subject to this. He was mean;\r\nand, like most other mean men, he lacked the ability to conceal his\r\nmeanness. Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder. He had been a poor\r\nman, master only of a Bay craft. He came into possession of all his\r\nslaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst.\r\nHe was cruel, but cowardly. He commanded without firmness. In the\r\nenforcement of his rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax. At\r\ntimes, he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the\r\nfury of a demon; at other times, he might well be mistaken for an\r\ninquirer who had lost his way. He did nothing of himself. He might have\r\npassed for a lion, but for his ears. In all things noble which he\r\nattempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous. His airs, words,\r\nand actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders,\r\nand, being assumed, were awkward enough. He was not even a good\r\nimitator. He possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the\r\npower. Having no resources within himself, he was compelled to be the\r\ncopyist of many, and being such, he was forever the victim of\r\ninconsistency; and of consequence he was an object of contempt, and was\r\nheld as such even by his slaves. The luxury of having slaves of his own\r\nto wait upon him was something new and unprepared for. He was a\r\nslaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. He found himself\r\nincapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud. We\r\nseldom called him \xe2\x80\x9cmaster;\xe2\x80\x9d we generally called him \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Auld,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwere hardly disposed to title him at all. I doubt not that our conduct\r\nhad much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence\r\nfretful. Our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly.\r\nHe wished to have us call him master, but lacked the firmness necessary\r\nto command us to do so. His wife used to insist upon our calling him\r\nso, but to no purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist\r\ncamp-meeting held in the Bay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced\r\nreligion. I indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to\r\nemancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not do this, it would, at\r\nany rate, make him more kind and humane. I was disappointed in both\r\nthese respects. It neither made him to be humane to his slaves, nor to\r\nemancipate them. If it had any effect on his character, it made him\r\nmore cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been\r\na much worse man after his conversion than before. Prior to his\r\nconversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him\r\nin his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious\r\nsanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty. He made the greatest\r\npretensions to piety. His house was the house of prayer. He prayed\r\nmorning, noon, and night. He very soon distinguished himself among his\r\nbrethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter. His activity\r\nin revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the hands\r\nof the church in converting many souls. His house was the preachers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhome. They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for\r\nwhile he starved us, he stuffed them. We have had three or four\r\npreachers there at a time. The names of those who used to come most\r\nfrequently while I lived there, were Mr. Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr.\r\nHumphry, and Mr. Hickey. I have also seen Mr. George Cookman at our\r\nhouse. We slaves loved Mr. Cookman. We believed him to be a good man.\r\nWe thought him instrumental in getting Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich\r\nslaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the\r\nimpression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the\r\nslaves. When he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to\r\nprayers. When the others were there, we were sometimes called in and\r\nsometimes not. Mr. Cookman took more notice of us than either of the\r\nother ministers. He could not come among us without betraying his\r\nsympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.\r\n\r\nWhile I lived with my master in St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s, there was a white young\r\nman, a Mr. Wilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the\r\ninstruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the\r\nNew Testament. We met but three times, when Mr. West and Mr. Fairbanks,\r\nboth class-leaders, with many others, came upon us with sticks and\r\nother missiles, drove us off, and forbade us to meet again. Thus ended\r\nour little Sabbath school in the pious town of St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nI have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty. As an\r\nexample, I will state one of many facts going to prove the charge. I\r\nhave seen him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with a heavy\r\ncowskin upon her naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip;\r\nand, in justification of the bloody deed, he would quote this passage\r\nof Scripture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe that knoweth his master\xe2\x80\x99s will, and doeth it not,\r\nshall be beaten with many stripes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid\r\nsituation four or five hours at a time. I have known him to tie her up\r\nearly in the morning, and whip her before breakfast; leave her, go to\r\nhis store, return at dinner, and whip her again, cutting her in the\r\nplaces already made raw with his cruel lash. The secret of master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncruelty toward \xe2\x80\x9cHenny\xe2\x80\x9d is found in the fact of her being almost\r\nhelpless. When quite a child, she fell into the fire, and burned\r\nherself horribly. Her hands were so burnt that she never got the use of\r\nthem. She could do very little but bear heavy burdens. She was to\r\nmaster a bill of expense; and as he was a mean man, she was a constant\r\noffence to him. He seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of\r\nexistence. He gave her away once to his sister; but, being a poor gift,\r\nshe was not disposed to keep her. Finally, my benevolent master, to use\r\nhis own words, \xe2\x80\x9cset her adrift to take care of herself.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was a\r\nrecently-converted man, holding on upon the mother, and at the same\r\ntime turning out her helpless child, to starve and die! Master Thomas\r\nwas one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very\r\ncharitable purpose of taking care of them.\r\n\r\nMy master and myself had quite a number of differences. He found me\r\nunsuitable to his purpose. My city life, he said, had had a very\r\npernicious effect upon me. It had almost ruined me for every good\r\npurpose, and fitted me for every thing which was bad. One of my\r\ngreatest faults was that of letting his horse run away, and go down to\r\nhis father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s farm, which was about five miles from St.\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s. I would then have to go after it. My reason for this kind of\r\ncarelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to\r\neat when I went there. Master William Hamilton, my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather-in-law, always gave his slaves enough to eat. I never left there\r\nhungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return. Master Thomas\r\nat length said he would stand it no longer. I had lived with him nine\r\nmonths, during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings,\r\nall to no good purpose. He resolved to put me out, as he said, to be\r\nbroken; and, for this purpose, he let me for one year to a man named\r\nEdward Covey. Mr. Covey was a poor man, a farm-renter. He rented the\r\nplace upon which he lived, as also the hands with which he tilled it.\r\nMr. Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young\r\nslaves, and this reputation was of immense value to him. It enabled him\r\nto get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could\r\nhave had it done without such a reputation. Some slaveholders thought\r\nit not much loss to allow Mr. Covey to have their slaves one year, for\r\nthe sake of the training to which they were subjected, without any\r\nother compensation. He could hire young help with great ease, in\r\nconsequence of this reputation. Added to the natural good qualities of\r\nMr. Covey, he was a professor of religion\xe2\x80\x94a pious soul\xe2\x80\x94a member and a\r\nclass-leader in the Methodist church. All of this added weight to his\r\nreputation as a \xe2\x80\x9cnigger-breaker.\xe2\x80\x9d I was aware of all the facts, having\r\nbeen made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there. I\r\nnevertheless made the change gladly; for I was sure of getting enough\r\nto eat, which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nI had left Master Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s house, and went to live with Mr. Covey, on\r\nthe 1st of January, 1833. I was now, for the first time in my life, a\r\nfield hand. In my new employment, I found myself even more awkward than\r\na country boy appeared to be in a large city. I had been at my new home\r\nbut one week before Mr. Covey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting\r\nmy back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as\r\nlarge as my little finger. The details of this affair are as follows:\r\nMr. Covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days\r\nin the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood. He gave\r\nme a team of unbroken oxen. He told me which was the in-hand ox, and\r\nwhich the off-hand one. He then tied the end of a large rope around the\r\nhorns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me,\r\nif the oxen started to run, that I must hold on upon the rope. I had\r\nnever driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward. I, however,\r\nsucceeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty;\r\nbut I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took\r\nfright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and\r\nover stumps, in the most frightful manner. I expected every moment that\r\nmy brains would be dashed out against the trees. After running thus for\r\na considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with\r\ngreat force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket.\r\nHow I escaped death, I do not know. There I was, entirely alone, in a\r\nthick wood, in a place new to me. My cart was upset and shattered, my\r\noxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help\r\nme. After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart\r\nrighted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart. I now\r\nproceeded with my team to the place where I had, the day before, been\r\nchopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way\r\nto tame my oxen. I then proceeded on my way home. I had now consumed\r\none half of the day. I got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of\r\ndanger. I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as I did so,\r\nbefore I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed\r\nthrough the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the\r\ncart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing\r\nme against the gate-post. Thus twice, in one short day, I escaped death\r\nby the merest chance. On my return, I told Mr. Covey what had happened,\r\nand how it happened. He ordered me to return to the woods again\r\nimmediately. I did so, and he followed on after me. Just as I got into\r\nthe woods, he came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he would\r\nteach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates. He then went to a\r\nlarge gum-tree, and with his axe cut three large switches, and, after\r\ntrimming them up neatly with his pocketknife, he ordered me to take off\r\nmy clothes. I made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on. He\r\nrepeated his order. I still made him no answer, nor did I move to strip\r\nmyself. Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore\r\noff my clothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches,\r\ncutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time\r\nafter. This whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for\r\nsimilar offences.\r\n\r\nI lived with Mr. Covey one year. During the first six months, of that\r\nyear, scarce a week passed without his whipping me. I was seldom free\r\nfrom a sore back. My awkwardness was almost always his excuse for\r\nwhipping me. We were worked fully up to the point of endurance. Long\r\nbefore day we were up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day\r\nwe were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams. Mr. Covey\r\ngave us enough to eat, but scarce time to eat it. We were often less\r\nthan five minutes taking our meals. We were often in the field from the\r\nfirst approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us; and at\r\nsaving-fodder time, midnight often caught us in the field binding\r\nblades.\r\n\r\nCovey would be out with us. The way he used to stand it, was this. He\r\nwould spend the most of his afternoons in bed. He would then come out\r\nfresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words, example, and\r\nfrequently with the whip. Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who\r\ncould and did work with his hands. He was a hard-working man. He knew\r\nby himself just what a man or a boy could do. There was no deceiving\r\nhim. His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence;\r\nand he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with\r\nus. This he did by surprising us. He seldom approached the spot where\r\nwe were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimed at\r\ntaking us by surprise. Such was his cunning, that we used to call him,\r\namong ourselves, \xe2\x80\x9cthe snake.\xe2\x80\x9d When we were at work in the cornfield, he\r\nwould sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and\r\nall at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, \xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha!\r\nCome, come! Dash on, dash on!\xe2\x80\x9d This being his mode of attack, it was\r\nnever safe to stop a single minute. His comings were like a thief in\r\nthe night. He appeared to us as being ever at hand. He was under every\r\ntree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the\r\nplantation. He would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to St.\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards\r\nyou would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching\r\nevery motion of the slaves. He would, for this purpose, leave his horse\r\ntied up in the woods. Again, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give\r\nus orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long\r\njourney, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the\r\nhouse to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would\r\nturn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and\r\nthere watch us till the going down of the sun.\r\n\r\nMr. Covey\xe2\x80\x99s _forte_ consisted in his power to deceive. His life was\r\ndevoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every\r\nthing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made\r\nconform to his disposition to deceive. He seemed to think himself equal\r\nto deceiving the Almighty. He would make a short prayer in the morning,\r\nand a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would\r\nat times appear more devotional than he. The exercises of his family\r\ndevotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very\r\npoor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon\r\nme. He would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at times\r\ndo so; at others, I would not. My non-compliance would almost always\r\nproduce much confusion. To show himself independent of me, he would\r\nstart and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner.\r\nIn this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor\r\nman! such was his disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily\r\nbelieve that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that\r\nhe was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a\r\ntime when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman\r\nslave to commit the sin of adultery. The facts in the case are these:\r\nMr. Covey was a poor man; he was just commencing in life; he was only\r\nable to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he bought her, as\r\nhe said, for _a breeder_. This woman was named Caroline. Mr. Covey\r\nbought her from Mr. Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nShe was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. She had\r\nalready given birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he\r\nwanted. After buying her, he hired a married man of Mr. Samuel\r\nHarrison, to live with him one year; and him he used to fasten up with\r\nher every night! The result was, that, at the end of the year, the\r\nmiserable woman gave birth to twins. At this result Mr. Covey seemed to\r\nbe highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman. Such was\r\nhis joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for Caroline\r\nduring her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done. The\r\nchildren were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.\r\n\r\nIf at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink\r\nthe bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six\r\nmonths of my stay with Mr. Covey. We were worked in all weathers. It\r\nwas never too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or\r\nsnow, too hard for us to work in the field. Work, work, work, was\r\nscarcely more the order of the day than of the night. The longest days\r\nwere too short for him, and the shortest nights too long for him. I was\r\nsomewhat unmanageable when I first went there, but a few months of this\r\ndiscipline tamed me. Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken\r\nin body, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my\r\nintellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful\r\nspark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed\r\nin upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!\r\n\r\nSunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beast-like\r\nstupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times I would\r\nrise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul,\r\naccompanied with a faint beam of hope, that flickered for a moment, and\r\nthen vanished. I sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition.\r\nI was sometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was\r\nprevented by a combination of hope and fear. My sufferings on this\r\nplantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.\r\n\r\nOur house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad\r\nbosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable\r\nglobe. Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to\r\nthe eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and\r\ntorment me with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the\r\ndeep stillness of a summer\xe2\x80\x99s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty\r\nbanks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful\r\neye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The\r\nsight of these always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compel\r\nutterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour\r\nout my soul\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the\r\nmoving multitude of ships:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am fast in my\r\nchains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I\r\nsadly before the bloody whip! You are freedom\xe2\x80\x99s swift-winged angels,\r\nthat fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were\r\nfree! O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your\r\nprotecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll. Go\r\non, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O,\r\nwhy was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship is gone;\r\nshe hides in the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of\r\nunending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is\r\nthere any God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it.\r\nGet caught, or get clear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it. I had as well die with ague as\r\nthe fever. I have only one life to lose. I had as well be killed\r\nrunning as die standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles straight\r\nnorth, and I am free! Try it? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be\r\nthat I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water. This very\r\nbay shall yet bear me into freedom. The steamboats steered in a\r\nnorth-east course from North Point. I will do the same; and when I get\r\nto the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight\r\nthrough Delaware into Pennsylvania. When I get there, I shall not be\r\nrequired to have a pass; I can travel without being disturbed. Let but\r\nthe first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I am off. Meanwhile,\r\nI will try to bear up under the yoke. I am not the only slave in the\r\nworld. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them. Besides, I\r\nam but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one. It may be that my\r\nmisery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free.\r\nThere is a better day coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost\r\nto madness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my\r\nwretched lot.\r\n\r\nI have already intimated that my condition was much worse, during the\r\nfirst six months of my stay at Mr. Covey\xe2\x80\x99s, than in the last six. The\r\ncircumstances leading to the change in Mr. Covey\xe2\x80\x99s course toward me\r\nform an epoch in my humble history. You have seen how a man was made a\r\nslave; you shall see how a slave was made a man. On one of the hottest\r\ndays of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave\r\nnamed Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat. Hughes was\r\nclearing the fanned wheat from before the fan. Eli was turning, Smith\r\nwas feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple,\r\nrequiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused\r\nto such work, it came very hard. About three o\xe2\x80\x99clock of that day, I\r\nbroke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching\r\nof the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb.\r\nFinding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do\r\nto stop work. I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with\r\ngrain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down\r\nby an immense weight. The fan of course stopped; every one had his own\r\nwork to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own\r\ngo on at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the\r\ntreading-yard where we were fanning. On hearing the fan stop, he left\r\nimmediately, and came to the spot where we were. He hastily inquired\r\nwhat the matter was. Bill answered that I was sick, and there was no\r\none to bring wheat to the fan. I had by this time crawled away under\r\nthe side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed,\r\nhoping to find relief by getting out of the sun. He then asked where I\r\nwas. He was told by one of the hands. He came to the spot, and, after\r\nlooking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter. I told him as well\r\nas I could, for I scarce had strength to speak. He then gave me a\r\nsavage kick in the side, and told me to get up. I tried to do so, but\r\nfell back in the attempt. He gave me another kick, and again told me to\r\nrise. I again tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but, stooping to\r\nget the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and\r\nfell. While down in this situation, Mr. Covey took up the hickory slat\r\nwith which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and\r\nwith it gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and\r\nthe blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up. I made no\r\neffort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him do his worst.\r\nIn a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better. Mr.\r\nCovey had now left me to my fate. At this moment I resolved, for the\r\nfirst time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his\r\nprotection. In order to do this, I must that afternoon walk seven\r\nmiles; and this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe\r\nundertaking. I was exceedingly feeble; made so as much by the kicks and\r\nblows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had\r\nbeen subjected. I, however, watched my chance, while Covey was looking\r\nin an opposite direction, and started for St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s. I succeeded in\r\ngetting a considerable distance on my way to the woods, when Covey\r\ndiscovered me, and called after me to come back, threatening what he\r\nwould do if I did not come. I disregarded both his calls and his\r\nthreats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would\r\nallow; and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road, I\r\nwalked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid\r\ndetection, and near enough to prevent losing my way. I had not gone far\r\nbefore my little strength again failed me. I could go no farther. I\r\nfell down, and lay for a considerable time. The blood was yet oozing\r\nfrom the wound on my head. For a time I thought I should bleed to\r\ndeath; and think now that I should have done so, but that the blood so\r\nmatted my hair as to stop the wound. After lying there about three\r\nquarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on my way,\r\nthrough bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feet\r\nsometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven\r\nmiles, occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstore. I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart\r\nof iron. From the crown of my head to my feet, I was covered with\r\nblood. My hair was all clotted with dust and blood; my shirt was stiff\r\nwith blood. I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild\r\nbeasts, and barely escaped them. In this state I appeared before my\r\nmaster, humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my\r\nprotection. I told him all the circumstances as well as I could, and it\r\nseemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him. He would then walk the\r\nfloor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it.\r\nHe asked me what I wanted. I told him, to let me get a new home; that\r\nas sure as I lived with Mr. Covey again, I should live with but to die\r\nwith him; that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a fair way for it.\r\nMaster Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr.\r\nCovey\xe2\x80\x99s killing me, and said that he knew Mr. Covey; that he was a good\r\nman, and that he could not think of taking me from him; that, should he\r\ndo so, he would lose the whole year\xe2\x80\x99s wages; that I belonged to Mr.\r\nCovey for one year, and that I must go back to him, come what might;\r\nand that I must not trouble him with any more stories, or that he would\r\nhimself _get hold of me_. After threatening me thus, he gave me a very\r\nlarge dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat night, (it being quite late,) but that I must be off back to Mr.\r\nCovey\xe2\x80\x99s early in the morning; and that if I did not, he would _get hold\r\nof me,_ which meant that he would whip me. I remained all night, and,\r\naccording to his orders, I started off to Covey\xe2\x80\x99s in the morning,\r\n(Saturday morning,) wearied in body and broken in spirit. I got no\r\nsupper that night, or breakfast that morning. I reached Covey\xe2\x80\x99s about\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided\r\nMrs. Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s fields from ours, out ran Covey with his cowskin, to give\r\nme another whipping. Before he could reach me, I succeeded in getting\r\nto the cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it afforded me the\r\nmeans of hiding. He seemed very angry, and searched for me a long time.\r\nMy behavior was altogether unaccountable. He finally gave up the chase,\r\nthinking, I suppose, that I must come home for something to eat; he\r\nwould give himself no further trouble in looking for me. I spent that\r\nday mostly in the woods, having the alternative before me,\xe2\x80\x94to go home\r\nand be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and be starved to death.\r\nThat night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was\r\nsomewhat acquainted. Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles\r\nfrom Mr. Covey\xe2\x80\x99s; and it being Saturday, he was on his way to see her.\r\nI told him my circumstances, and he very kindly invited me to go home\r\nwith him. I went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and\r\ngot his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue. I found\r\nSandy an old adviser. He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back\r\nto Covey; but that before I went, I must go with him into another part\r\nof the woods, where there was a certain _root,_ which, if I would take\r\nsome of it with me, carrying it _always on my right side,_ would render\r\nit impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me. He\r\nsaid he had carried it for years; and since he had done so, he had\r\nnever received a blow, and never expected to while he carried it. I at\r\nfirst rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my\r\npocket would have any such effect as he had said, and was not disposed\r\nto take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness,\r\ntelling me it could do no harm, if it did no good. To please him, I at\r\nlength took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it upon\r\nmy right side. This was Sunday morning. I immediately started for home;\r\nand upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his way to\r\nmeeting. He spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot\r\nnear by, and passed on towards the church. Now, this singular conduct\r\nof Mr. Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in\r\nthe _root_ which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day\r\nthan Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than\r\nthe influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclined to think\r\nthe _root_ to be something more than I at first had taken it to be. All\r\nwent well till Monday morning. On this morning, the virtue of the\r\n_root_ was fully tested. Long before daylight, I was called to go and\r\nrub, curry, and feed, the horses. I obeyed, and was glad to obey. But\r\nwhilst thus engaged, whilst in the act of throwing down some blades\r\nfrom the loft, Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and just\r\nas I was half out of the loft, he caught hold of my legs, and was about\r\ntying me. As soon as I found what he was up to, I gave a sudden spring,\r\nand as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the\r\nstable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do\r\nwhat he pleased; but at this moment\xe2\x80\x94from whence came the spirit I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I\r\nseized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to\r\nme, and I to him. My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey\r\nseemed taken all aback. He trembled like a leaf. This gave me\r\nassurance, and I held him uneasy, causing the blood to run where I\r\ntouched him with the ends of my fingers. Mr. Covey soon called out to\r\nHughes for help. Hughes came, and, while Covey held me, attempted to\r\ntie my right hand. While he was in the act of doing so, I watched my\r\nchance, and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs. This kick\r\nfairly sickened Hughes, so that he left me in the hands of Mr. Covey.\r\nThis kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also.\r\nWhen he saw Hughes bending over with pain, his courage quailed. He\r\nasked me if I meant to persist in my resistance. I told him I did, come\r\nwhat might; that he had used me like a brute for six months, and that I\r\nwas determined to be used so no longer. With that, he strove to drag me\r\nto a stick that was lying just out of the stable door. He meant to\r\nknock me down. But just as he was leaning over to get the stick, I\r\nseized him with both hands by his collar, and brought him by a sudden\r\nsnatch to the ground. By this time, Bill came. Covey called upon him\r\nfor assistance. Bill wanted to know what he could do. Covey said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\nhold of him, take hold of him!\xe2\x80\x9d Bill said his master hired him out to\r\nwork, and not to help to whip me; so he left Covey and myself to fight\r\nour own battle out. We were at it for nearly two hours. Covey at length\r\nlet me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that if I had\r\nnot resisted, he would not have whipped me half so much. The truth was,\r\nthat he had not whipped me at all. I considered him as getting entirely\r\nthe worst end of the bargain; for he had drawn no blood from me, but I\r\nhad from him. The whole six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr.\r\nCovey, he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger. He\r\nwould occasionally say, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get hold of me again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not; for you will come off worse than you did\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a\r\nslave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived\r\nwithin me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed\r\nself-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be free.\r\nThe gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for\r\nwhatever else might follow, even death itself. He only can understand\r\nthe deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelled by\r\nforce the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never felt before. It was\r\na glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of\r\nfreedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance\r\ntook its place; and I now resolved that, however long I might remain a\r\nslave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in\r\nfact. I did not hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white man\r\nwho expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped,\r\nthough I remained a slave four years afterwards. I had several fights,\r\nbut was never whipped.\r\n\r\nIt was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr. Covey did not\r\nimmediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post, and\r\nthere regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a\r\nwhite man in defence of myself. And the only explanation I can now\r\nthink of does not entirely satisfy me; but such as it is, I will give\r\nit. Mr. Covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a\r\nfirst-rate overseer and negro-breaker. It was of considerable\r\nimportance to him. That reputation was at stake; and had he sent me\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nboy about sixteen years old\xe2\x80\x94to the public whipping-post, his reputation\r\nwould have been lost; so, to save his reputation, he suffered me to go\r\nunpunished.\r\n\r\nMy term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day,\r\n1833. The days between Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s day are allowed as\r\nholidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor,\r\nmore than to feed and take care of the stock. This time we regarded as\r\nour own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused\r\nit nearly as we pleased. Those of us who had families at a distance,\r\nwere generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society.\r\nThis time, however, was spent in various ways. The staid, sober,\r\nthinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in\r\nmaking corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class\r\nof us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons. But\r\nby far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing\r\nball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking\r\nwhisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most\r\nagreeable to the feelings of our masters. A slave who would work during\r\nthe holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them.\r\nHe was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master. It was\r\ndeemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as\r\nlazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means,\r\nduring the year, to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I\r\nbelieve them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the\r\nslaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection. Were the\r\nslaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I have not the slightest\r\ndoubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves.\r\nThese holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the\r\nrebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. But for these, the slave would\r\nbe forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the\r\nslaveholder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of\r\nthose conductors! I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go\r\nforth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nThe holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and\r\ninhumanity of slavery. They are professedly a custom established by the\r\nbenevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the\r\nresult of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon\r\nthe down-trodden slave. They do not give the slaves this time because\r\nthey would not like to have their work during its continuance, but\r\nbecause they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will\r\nbe seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves\r\nspend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their\r\nending as of their beginning. Their object seems to be, to disgust\r\ntheir slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of\r\ndissipation. For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the\r\nslave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him\r\ndrunk. One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink\r\nthe most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in\r\ngetting whole multitudes to drink to excess. Thus, when the slave asks\r\nfor virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance,\r\ncheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with\r\nthe name of liberty. The most of us used to drink it down, and the\r\nresult was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think\r\nthat there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. We felt,\r\nand very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as\r\nto rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of\r\nour wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,\xe2\x80\x94feeling,\r\nupon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us\r\ninto a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.\r\n\r\nI have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system\r\nof fraud and inhumanity of slavery. It is so. The mode here adopted to\r\ndisgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse\r\nof it, is carried out in other things. For instance, a slave loves\r\nmolasses; he steals some. His master, in many cases, goes off to town,\r\nand buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip, and commands the\r\nslave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the\r\nvery mention of it. The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the\r\nslaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance.\r\nA slave runs through his allowance, and applies for more. His master is\r\nenraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives\r\nhim more than is necessary, and compels him to eat it within a given\r\ntime. Then, if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be\r\nsatisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to\r\nplease! I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same\r\nprinciple, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have\r\ncited sufficient. The practice is a very common one.\r\n\r\nOn the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. Covey, and went to live with\r\nMr. William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\nsoon found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. Covey. Though not\r\nrich, he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman. Mr.\r\nCovey, as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker and\r\nslave-driver. The former (slaveholder though he was) seemed to possess\r\nsome regard for honor, some reverence for justice, and some respect for\r\nhumanity. The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments.\r\nMr. Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as\r\nbeing very passionate and fretful; but I must do him the justice to\r\nsay, that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which\r\nMr. Covey was constantly addicted. The one was open and frank, and we\r\nalways knew where to find him. The other was a most artful deceiver,\r\nand could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect\r\nhis cunningly-devised frauds. Another advantage I gained in my new\r\nmaster was, he made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and\r\nthis, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage. I assert most\r\nunhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for\r\nthe most horrid crimes,\xe2\x80\x94a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsanctifier of the most hateful frauds,\xe2\x80\x94and a dark shelter under, which\r\nthe darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders\r\nfind the strongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains\r\nof slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave\r\nof a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For\r\nof all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders\r\nare the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most\r\ncruel and cowardly, of all others. It was my unhappy lot not only to\r\nbelong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such\r\nreligionists. Very near Mr. Freeland lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, and\r\nin the same neighborhood lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins. These were\r\nmembers and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church. Mr. Weeden\r\nowned, among others, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten. This\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s back, for weeks, was kept literally raw, made so by the lash of\r\nthis merciless, _religious_ wretch. He used to hire hands. His maxim\r\nwas, Behave well or behave ill, it is the duty of a master occasionally\r\nto whip a slave, to remind him of his master\xe2\x80\x99s authority. Such was his\r\ntheory, and such his practice.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden. His chief boast was his\r\nability to manage slaves. The peculiar feature of his government was\r\nthat of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it. He always managed\r\nto have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning. He did\r\nthis to alarm their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped.\r\nHis plan was to whip for the smallest offences, to prevent the\r\ncommission of large ones. Mr. Hopkins could always find some excuse for\r\nwhipping a slave. It would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slaveholding\r\nlife, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things, of\r\nwhich to make occasion to whip a slave. A mere look, word, or motion,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmistake, accident, or want of power,\xe2\x80\x94are all matters for which a slave\r\nmay be whipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied? It is said,\r\nhe has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out. Does he speak\r\nloudly when spoken to by his master? Then he is getting high-minded,\r\nand should be taken down a button-hole lower. Does he forget to pull\r\noff his hat at the approach of a white person? Then he is wanting in\r\nreverence, and should be whipped for it. Does he ever venture to\r\nvindicate his conduct, when censured for it? Then he is guilty of\r\nimpudence,\xe2\x80\x94one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty.\r\nDoes he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from\r\nthat pointed out by his master? He is indeed presumptuous, and getting\r\nabove himself; and nothing less than a flogging will do for him. Does\r\nhe, while ploughing, break a plough,\xe2\x80\x94or, while hoeing, break a hoe? It\r\nis owing to his carelessness, and for it a slave must always be\r\nwhipped. Mr. Hopkins could always find something of this sort to\r\njustify the use of the lash, and he seldom failed to embrace such\r\nopportunities. There was not a man in the whole county, with whom the\r\nslaves who had the getting their own home, would not prefer to live,\r\nrather than with this Rev. Mr. Hopkins. And yet there was not a man any\r\nwhere round, who made higher professions of religion, or was more\r\nactive in revivals,\xe2\x80\x94more attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer and\r\npreaching meetings, or more devotional in his family,\xe2\x80\x94that prayed\r\nearlier, later, louder, and longer,\xe2\x80\x94than this same reverend\r\nslave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mr. Freeland, and to my experience while in his\r\nemployment. He, like Mr. Covey, gave us enough to eat; but, unlike Mr.\r\nCovey, he also gave us sufficient time to take our meals. He worked us\r\nhard, but always between sunrise and sunset. He required a good deal of\r\nwork to be done, but gave us good tools with which to work. His farm\r\nwas large, but he employed hands enough to work it, and with ease,\r\ncompared with many of his neighbors. My treatment, while in his\r\nemployment, was heavenly, compared with what I experienced at the hands\r\nof Mr. Edward Covey.\r\n\r\nMr. Freeland was himself the owner of but two slaves. Their names were\r\nHenry Harris and John Harris. The rest of his hands he hired. These\r\nconsisted of myself, Sandy Jenkins,[1] and Handy Caldwell.\r\n\r\n [1] This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being\r\n whipped by Mr. Covey. He was \xe2\x80\x9ca clever soul.\xe2\x80\x9d We used frequently to\r\n talk about the fight with Covey, and as often as we did so, he would\r\n claim my success as the result of the roots which he gave me. This\r\n superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves. A slave\r\n seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry and John were quite intelligent, and in a very little while after\r\nI went there, I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn\r\nhow to read. This desire soon sprang up in the others also. They very\r\nsoon mustered up some old spelling-books, and nothing would do but that\r\nI must keep a Sabbath school. I agreed to do so, and accordingly\r\ndevoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to\r\nread. Neither of them knew his letters when I went there. Some of the\r\nslaves of the neighboring farms found what was going on, and also\r\navailed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read. It was\r\nunderstood, among all who came, that there must be as little display\r\nabout it as possible. It was necessary to keep our religious masters at\r\nSt. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s unacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the\r\nSabbath in wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to\r\nlearn how to read the will of God; for they had much rather see us\r\nengaged in those degrading sports, than to see us behaving like\r\nintellectual, moral, and accountable beings. My blood boils as I think\r\nof the bloody manner in which Messrs. Wright Fairbanks and Garrison\r\nWest, both class-leaders, in connection with many others, rushed in\r\nupon us with sticks and stones, and broke up our virtuous little\r\nSabbath school, at St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94all calling themselves Christians!\r\nhumble followers of the Lord Jesus Christ! But I am again digressing.\r\n\r\nI held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man, whose name\r\nI deem it imprudent to mention; for should it be known, it might\r\nembarrass him greatly, though the crime of holding the school was\r\ncommitted ten years ago. I had at one time over forty scholars, and\r\nthose of the right sort, ardently desiring to learn. They were of all\r\nages, though mostly men and women. I look back to those Sundays with an\r\namount of pleasure not to be expressed. They were great days to my\r\nsoul. The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest\r\nengagement with which I was ever blessed. We loved each other, and to\r\nleave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed. When\r\nI think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the\r\nprison-house of slavery, my feelings overcome me, and I am almost ready\r\nto ask, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes a righteous God govern the universe? and for what does he\r\nhold the thunders in his right hand, if not to smite the oppressor, and\r\ndeliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?\xe2\x80\x9d These dear souls\r\ncame not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nor did I\r\nteach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged. Every moment\r\nthey spent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given\r\nthirty-nine lashes. They came because they wished to learn. Their minds\r\nhad been starved by their cruel masters. They had been shut up in\r\nmental darkness. I taught them, because it was the delight of my soul\r\nto be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my\r\nrace. I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr.\r\nFreeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three evenings in\r\nthe week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home. And I have\r\nthe happiness to know, that several of those who came to Sabbath school\r\nlearned how to read; and that one, at least, is now free through my\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nThe year passed off smoothly. It seemed only about half as long as the\r\nyear which preceded it. I went through it without receiving a single\r\nblow. I will give Mr. Freeland the credit of being the best master I\r\never had, _till I became my own master._ For the ease with which I\r\npassed the year, I was, however, somewhat indebted to the society of my\r\nfellow-slaves. They were noble souls; they not only possessed loving\r\nhearts, but brave ones. We were linked and interlinked with each other.\r\nI loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced\r\nsince. It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in\r\neach other. In answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved any\r\nor confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves, and especially\r\nthose with whom I lived at Mr. Freeland\xe2\x80\x99s. I believe we would have died\r\nfor each other. We never undertook to do any thing, of any importance,\r\nwithout a mutual consultation. We never moved separately. We were one;\r\nand as much so by our tempers and dispositions, as by the mutual\r\nhardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1834, Mr. Freeland again hired me of my\r\nmaster, for the year 1835. But, by this time, I began to want to live\r\n_upon free land_ as well as _with Freeland;_ and I was no longer\r\ncontent, therefore, to live with him or any other slaveholder. I began,\r\nwith the commencement of the year, to prepare myself for a final\r\nstruggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other. My tendency\r\nwas upward. I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had\r\npassed, and I was still a slave. These thoughts roused me\xe2\x80\x94I must do\r\nsomething. I therefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without\r\nwitnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty. But I was not\r\nwilling to cherish this determination alone. My fellow-slaves were dear\r\nto me. I was anxious to have them participate with me in this, my\r\nlife-giving determination. I therefore, though with great prudence,\r\ncommenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to\r\ntheir condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom. I\r\nbent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhile\r\nstrove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud\r\nand inhumanity of slavery. I went first to Henry, next to John, then to\r\nthe others. I found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits. They\r\nwere ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible plan should be\r\nproposed. This was what I wanted. I talked to them of our want of\r\nmanhood, if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble\r\neffort to be free. We met often, and consulted frequently, and told our\r\nhopes and fears, recounted the difficulties, real and imagined, which\r\nwe should be called on to meet. At times we were almost disposed to\r\ngive up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; at others,\r\nwe were firm and unbending in our determination to go. Whenever we\r\nsuggested any plan, there was shrinking\xe2\x80\x94the odds were fearful. Our path\r\nwas beset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining\r\nthe end of it, our right to be free was yet questionable\xe2\x80\x94we were yet\r\nliable to be returned to bondage. We could see no spot, this side of\r\nthe ocean, where we could be free. We knew nothing about Canada. Our\r\nknowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York; and to go\r\nthere, and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being\r\nreturned to slavery\xe2\x80\x94with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse\r\nthan before\xe2\x80\x94the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which it was\r\nnot easy to overcome. The case sometimes stood thus: At every gate\r\nthrough which we were to pass, we saw a watchman\xe2\x80\x94at every ferry a\r\nguard\xe2\x80\x94on every bridge a sentinel\xe2\x80\x94and in every wood a patrol. We were\r\nhemmed in upon every side. Here were the difficulties, real or\r\nimagined\xe2\x80\x94the good to be sought, and the evil to be shunned. On the one\r\nhand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaring frightfully upon\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x94its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even\r\nnow feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh. On the other hand,\r\naway back in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north\r\nstar, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a\r\ndoubtful freedom\xe2\x80\x94half frozen\xe2\x80\x94beckoning us to come and share its\r\nhospitality. This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us; but\r\nwhen we permitted ourselves to survey the road, we were frequently\r\nappalled. Upon either side we saw grim death, assuming the most horrid\r\nshapes. Now it was starvation, causing us to eat our own flesh;\xe2\x80\x94now we\r\nwere contending with the waves, and were drowned;\xe2\x80\x94now we were\r\novertaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound.\r\nWe were stung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes,\r\nand finally, after having nearly reached the desired spot,\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nswimming rivers, encountering wild beasts, sleeping in the woods,\r\nsuffering hunger and nakedness,\xe2\x80\x94we were overtaken by our pursuers, and,\r\nin our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot! I say, this picture\r\nsometimes appalled us, and made us\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crather bear those ills we had,\r\nThan fly to others, that we knew not of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn coming to a fixed determination to run away, we did more than\r\nPatrick Henry, when he resolved upon liberty or death. With us it was a\r\ndoubtful liberty at most, and almost certain death if we failed. For my\r\npart, I should prefer death to hopeless bondage.\r\n\r\nSandy, one of our number, gave up the notion, but still encouraged us.\r\nOur company then consisted of Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey,\r\nCharles Roberts, and myself. Henry Bailey was my uncle, and belonged to\r\nmy master. Charles married my aunt: he belonged to my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather-in-law, Mr. William Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe plan we finally concluded upon was, to get a large canoe belonging\r\nto Mr. Hamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter\r\nholidays, paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay. On our arrival at the\r\nhead of the bay, a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we\r\nlived, it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift, and follow the\r\nguidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of Maryland.\r\nOur reason for taking the water route was, that we were less liable to\r\nbe suspected as runaways; we hoped to be regarded as fishermen;\r\nwhereas, if we should take the land route, we should be subjected to\r\ninterruptions of almost every kind. Any one having a white face, and\r\nbeing so disposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination.\r\n\r\nThe week before our intended start, I wrote several protections, one\r\nfor each of us. As well as I can remember, they were in the following\r\nwords, to wit:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my\r\nservant, full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter\r\nholidays. Written with mine own hand, &c., 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWILLIAM HAMILTON,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s, in Talbot county, Maryland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up the bay, we went\r\ntoward Baltimore, and these protections were only intended to protect\r\nus while on the bay.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near for our departure, our anxiety became more and\r\nmore intense. It was truly a matter of life and death with us. The\r\nstrength of our determination was about to be fully tested. At this\r\ntime, I was very active in explaining every difficulty, removing every\r\ndoubt, dispelling every fear, and inspiring all with the firmness\r\nindispensable to success in our undertaking; assuring them that half\r\nwas gained the instant we made the move; we had talked long enough; we\r\nwere now ready to move; if not now, we never should be; and if we did\r\nnot intend to move now, we had as well fold our arms, sit down, and\r\nacknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves. This, none of us were\r\nprepared to acknowledge. Every man stood firm; and at our last meeting,\r\nwe pledged ourselves afresh, in the most solemn manner, that, at the\r\ntime appointed, we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom. This\r\nwas in the middle of the week, at the end of which we were to be off.\r\nWe went, as usual, to our several fields of labor, but with bosoms\r\nhighly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking. We\r\ntried to conceal our feelings as much as possible; and I think we\r\nsucceeded very well.\r\n\r\nAfter a painful waiting, the Saturday morning, whose night was to\r\nwitness our departure, came. I hailed it with joy, bring what of\r\nsadness it might. Friday night was a sleepless one for me. I probably\r\nfelt more anxious than the rest, because I was, by common consent, at\r\nthe head of the whole affair. The responsibility of success or failure\r\nlay heavily upon me. The glory of the one, and the confusion of the\r\nother, were alike mine. The first two hours of that morning were such\r\nas I never experienced before, and hope never to again. Early in the\r\nmorning, we went, as usual, to the field. We were spreading manure; and\r\nall at once, while thus engaged, I was overwhelmed with an\r\nindescribable feeling, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who\r\nwas near by, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are betrayed!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthought has this moment struck me.\xe2\x80\x9d We said no more. I was never more\r\ncertain of any thing.\r\n\r\nThe horn was blown as usual, and we went up from the field to the house\r\nfor breakfast. I went for the form, more than for want of any thing to\r\neat that morning. Just as I got to the house, in looking out at the\r\nlane gate, I saw four white men, with two colored men. The white men\r\nwere on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if\r\ntied. I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate.\r\nHere they halted, and tied the colored men to the gate-post. I was not\r\nyet certain as to what the matter was. In a few moments, in rode Mr.\r\nHamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement. He came to the\r\ndoor, and inquired if Master William was in. He was told he was at the\r\nbarn. Mr. Hamilton, without dismounting, rode up to the barn with\r\nextraordinary speed. In a few moments, he and Mr. Freeland returned to\r\nthe house. By this time, the three constables rode up, and in great\r\nhaste dismounted, tied their horses, and met Master William and Mr.\r\nHamilton returning from the barn; and after talking awhile, they all\r\nwalked up to the kitchen door. There was no one in the kitchen but\r\nmyself and John. Henry and Sandy were up at the barn. Mr. Freeland put\r\nhis head in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some\r\ngentlemen at the door who wished to see me. I stepped to the door, and\r\ninquired what they wanted. They at once seized me, and, without giving\r\nme any satisfaction, tied me\xe2\x80\x94lashing my hands closely together. I\r\ninsisted upon knowing what the matter was. They at length said, that\r\nthey had learned I had been in a \xe2\x80\x9cscrape,\xe2\x80\x9d and that I was to be\r\nexamined before my master; and if their information proved false, I\r\nshould not be hurt.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, they succeeded in tying John. They then turned to\r\nHenry, who had by this time returned, and commanded him to cross his\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, in a firm tone, indicating his readiness\r\nto meet the consequences of his refusal. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Graham,\r\nthe constable. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, in a still stronger tone.\r\nWith this, two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols, and\r\nswore, by their Creator, that they would make him cross his hands or\r\nkill him. Each cocked his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger,\r\nwalked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his\r\nhands, they would blow his damned heart out. \xe2\x80\x9cShoot me, shoot me!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHenry; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t kill me but once. Shoot, shoot,\xe2\x80\x94and be damned! _I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be tied!_\xe2\x80\x9d This he said in a tone of loud defiance; and at the\r\nsame time, with a motion as quick as lightning, he with one single\r\nstroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable. As he did\r\nthis, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating him some time, they\r\nfinally overpowered him, and got him tied.\r\n\r\nDuring the scuffle, I managed, I know not how, to get my pass out, and,\r\nwithout being discovered, put it into the fire. We were all now tied;\r\nand just as we were to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, mother of\r\nWilliam Freeland, came to the door with her hands full of biscuits, and\r\ndivided them between Henry and John. She then delivered herself of a\r\nspeech, to the following effect:\xe2\x80\x94addressing herself to me, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You devil! You yellow devil!_ it was you that put it into the heads\r\nof Henry and John to run away. But for you, you long-legged mulatto\r\ndevil! Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d I made\r\nno reply, and was immediately hurried off towards St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s. Just a\r\nmoment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr. Hamilton suggested the\r\npropriety of making a search for the protections which he had\r\nunderstood Frederick had written for himself and the rest. But, just at\r\nthe moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect, his aid was\r\nneeded in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending the\r\nscuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under the\r\ncircumstances, to search. So we were not yet convicted of the intention\r\nto run away.\r\n\r\nWhen we got about half way to St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s, while the constables\r\nhaving us in charge were looking ahead, Henry inquired of me what he\r\nshould do with his pass. I told him to eat it with his biscuit, and own\r\nnothing; and we passed the word around, \xe2\x80\x9c_Own nothing;_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_Own\r\nnothing!_\xe2\x80\x9d said we all. Our confidence in each other was unshaken. We\r\nwere resolved to succeed or fail together, after the calamity had\r\nbefallen us as much as before. We were now prepared for any thing. We\r\nwere to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses, and then\r\nto be placed in the Easton jail. When we reached St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s, we\r\nunderwent a sort of examination. We all denied that we ever intended to\r\nrun away. We did this more to bring out the evidence against us, than\r\nfrom any hope of getting clear of being sold; for, as I have said, we\r\nwere ready for that. The fact was, we cared but little where we went,\r\nso we went together. Our greatest concern was about separation. We\r\ndreaded that more than any thing this side of death. We found the\r\nevidence against us to be the testimony of one person; our master would\r\nnot tell who it was; but we came to a unanimous decision among\r\nourselves as to who their informant was. We were sent off to the jail\r\nat Easton. When we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr.\r\nJoseph Graham, and by him placed in jail. Henry, John, and myself, were\r\nplaced in one room together\xe2\x80\x94Charles, and Henry Bailey, in another.\r\nTheir object in separating us was to hinder concert.\r\n\r\nWe had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes, when a swarm of slave\r\ntraders, and agents for slave traders, flocked into jail to look at us,\r\nand to ascertain if we were for sale. Such a set of beings I never saw\r\nbefore! I felt myself surrounded by so many fiends from perdition. A\r\nband of pirates never looked more like their father, the devil. They\r\nlaughed and grinned over us, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my boys! we have got you,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d And after taunting us in various ways, they one by one\r\nwent into an examination of us, with intent to ascertain our value.\r\nThey would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our\r\nmasters. We would make them no answer, and leave them to find out as\r\nbest they could. Then they would curse and swear at us, telling us that\r\nthey could take the devil out of us in a very little while, if we were\r\nonly in their hands.\r\n\r\nWhile in jail, we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters\r\nthan we expected when we went there. We did not get much to eat, nor\r\nthat which was very good; but we had a good clean room, from the\r\nwindows of which we could see what was going on in the street, which\r\nwas very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark,\r\ndamp cells. Upon the whole, we got along very well, so far as the jail\r\nand its keeper were concerned. Immediately after the holidays were\r\nover, contrary to all our expectations, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland\r\ncame up to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of\r\njail, and carried them home, leaving me alone. I regarded this\r\nseparation as a final one. It caused me more pain than any thing else\r\nin the whole transaction. I was ready for any thing rather than\r\nseparation. I supposed that they had consulted together, and had\r\ndecided that, as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others\r\nto run away, it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty;\r\nand that they had, therefore, concluded to take the others home, and\r\nsell me, as a warning to the others that remained. It is due to the\r\nnoble Henry to say, he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison\r\nas at leaving home to come to the prison. But we knew we should, in all\r\nprobability, be separated, if we were sold; and since he was in their\r\nhands, he concluded to go peaceably home.\r\n\r\nI was now left to my fate. I was all alone, and within the walls of a\r\nstone prison. But a few days before, and I was full of hope. I expected\r\nto have been safe in a land of freedom; but now I was covered with\r\ngloom, sunk down to the utmost despair. I thought the possibility of\r\nfreedom was gone. I was kept in this way about one week, at the end of\r\nwhich, Captain Auld, my master, to my surprise and utter astonishment,\r\ncame up, and took me out, with the intention of sending me, with a\r\ngentleman of his acquaintance, into Alabama. But, from some cause or\r\nother, he did not send me to Alabama, but concluded to send me back to\r\nBaltimore, to live again with his brother Hugh, and to learn a trade.\r\n\r\nThus, after an absence of three years and one month, I was once more\r\npermitted to return to my old home at Baltimore. My master sent me\r\naway, because there existed against me a very great prejudice in the\r\ncommunity, and he feared I might be killed.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr.\r\nWilliam Gardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell\xe2\x80\x99s Point. I was put\r\nthere to learn how to calk. It, however, proved a very unfavorable\r\nplace for the accomplishment of this object. Mr. Gardner was engaged\r\nthat spring in building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for the\r\nMexican government. The vessels were to be launched in the July of that\r\nyear, and in failure thereof, Mr. Gardner was to lose a considerable\r\nsum; so that when I entered, all was hurry. There was no time to learn\r\nany thing. Every man had to do that which he knew how to do. In\r\nentering the shipyard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do whatever\r\nthe carpenters commanded me to do. This was placing me at the beck and\r\ncall of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters.\r\nTheir word was to be my law. My situation was a most trying one. At\r\ntimes I needed a dozen pair of hands. I was called a dozen ways in the\r\nspace of a single minute. Three or four voices would strike my ear at\r\nthe same moment. It was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., come help me to cant this timber\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., come carry this timber yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., bring that\r\nroller here.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., go get a fresh can of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., come help\r\nsaw off the end of this timber.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., go quick, and get the\r\ncrowbar.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., hold on the end of this fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFred., go to the\r\nblacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and get a new punch.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHurra, Fred! run and bring me\r\na cold chisel.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fire as quick\r\nas lightning under that steam-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo, nigger! come, turn this\r\ngrindstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! move, move! and _bowse_ this timber\r\nforward.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI say, darky, blast your eyes, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you heat up some\r\npitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo! halloo! halloo!\xe2\x80\x9d (Three voices at the same time.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\xe2\x80\x94Go there!\xe2\x80\x94Hold on where you are! Damn you, if you move,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll knock your brains out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was my school for eight months; and I might have remained there\r\nlonger, but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white\r\napprentices, in which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I was\r\nhorribly mangled in other respects. The facts in the case were these:\r\nUntil a very little while after I went there, white and black\r\nship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any\r\nimpropriety in it. All hands seemed to be very well satisfied. Many of\r\nthe black carpenters were freemen. Things seemed to be going on very\r\nwell. All at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they\r\nwould not work with free colored workmen. Their reason for this, as\r\nalleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they\r\nwould soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men\r\nwould be thrown out of employment. They therefore felt called upon at\r\nonce to put a stop to it. And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnecessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless\r\nhe would discharge his black carpenters. Now, though this did not\r\nextend to me in form, it did reach me in fact. My fellow-apprentices\r\nvery soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me. They\r\nbegan to put on airs, and talk about the \xe2\x80\x9cniggers\xe2\x80\x9d taking the country,\r\nsaying we all ought to be killed; and, being encouraged by the\r\njourneymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as they could,\r\nby hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me. I, of course, kept\r\nthe vow I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck back again,\r\nregardless of consequences; and while I kept them from combining, I\r\nsucceeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them\r\nseparately. They, however, at length combined, and came upon me, armed\r\nwith sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes. One came in front with a\r\nhalf brick. There was one at each side of me, and one behind me. While\r\nI was attending to those in front, and on either side, the one behind\r\nran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head. It\r\nstunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to\r\nbeating me with their fists. I let them lay on for a while, gathering\r\nstrength. In an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands\r\nand knees. Just as I did that, one of their number gave me, with his\r\nheavy boot, a powerful kick in the left eye. My eyeball seemed to have\r\nburst. When they saw my eye closed, and badly swollen, they left me.\r\nWith this I seized the handspike, and for a time pursued them. But here\r\nthe carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well give it up. It\r\nwas impossible to stand my hand against so many. All this took place in\r\nsight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one\r\ninterposed a friendly word; but some cried, \xe2\x80\x9cKill the damned nigger!\r\nKill him! kill him! He struck a white person.\xe2\x80\x9d I found my only chance\r\nfor life was in flight. I succeeded in getting away without an\r\nadditional blow, and barely so; for to strike a white man is death by\r\nLynch law,\xe2\x80\x94and that was the law in Mr. Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s ship-yard; nor is\r\nthere much of any other out of Mr. Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s ship-yard.\r\n\r\nI went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh;\r\nand I am happy to say of him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was\r\nheavenly, compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar\r\ncircumstances. He listened attentively to my narration of the\r\ncircumstances leading to the savage outrage, and gave many proofs of\r\nhis strong indignation at it. The heart of my once overkind mistress\r\nwas again melted into pity. My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face\r\nmoved her to tears. She took a chair by me, washed the blood from my\r\nface, and, with a mother\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness, bound up my head, covering the\r\nwounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation\r\nfor my suffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness\r\nfrom this, my once affectionate old mistress. Master Hugh was very much\r\nenraged. He gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon\r\nthe heads of those who did the deed. As soon as I got a little the\r\nbetter of my bruises, he took me with him to Esquire Watson\xe2\x80\x99s, on Bond\r\nStreet, to see what could be done about the matter. Mr. Watson inquired\r\nwho saw the assault committed. Master Hugh told him it was done in Mr.\r\nGardner\xe2\x80\x99s ship-yard at midday, where there were a large company of men\r\nat work. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe deed was done, and there was no\r\nquestion as to who did it.\xe2\x80\x9d His answer was, he could do nothing in the\r\ncase, unless some white man would come forward and testify. He could\r\nissue no warrant on my word. If I had been killed in the presence of a\r\nthousand colored people, their testimony combined would have been\r\ninsufficient to have arrested one of the murderers. Master Hugh, for\r\nonce, was compelled to say this state of things was too bad. Of course,\r\nit was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my\r\nbehalf, and against the white young men. Even those who may have\r\nsympathized with me were not prepared to do this. It required a degree\r\nof courage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the\r\nslightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was\r\ndenounced as abolitionism, and that name subjected its bearer to\r\nfrightful liabilities. The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that\r\nregion, and in those days, were, \xe2\x80\x9cDamn the abolitionists!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDamn\r\nthe niggers!\xe2\x80\x9d There was nothing done, and probably nothing would have\r\nbeen done if I had been killed. Such was, and such remains, the state\r\nof things in the Christian city of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nMaster Hugh, finding he could get no redress, refused to let me go back\r\nagain to Mr. Gardner. He kept me himself, and his wife dressed my wound\r\ntill I was again restored to health. He then took me into the ship-yard\r\nof which he was foreman, in the employment of Mr. Walter Price. There I\r\nwas immediately set to calking, and very soon learned the art of using\r\nmy mallet and irons. In the course of one year from the time I left Mr.\r\nGardner\xe2\x80\x99s, I was able to command the highest wages given to the most\r\nexperienced calkers. I was now of some importance to my master. I was\r\nbringing him from six to seven dollars per week. I sometimes brought\r\nhim nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day.\r\nAfter learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own\r\ncontracts, and collected the money which I earned. My pathway became\r\nmuch more smooth than before; my condition was now much more\r\ncomfortable. When I could get no calking to do, I did nothing. During\r\nthese leisure times, those old notions about freedom would steal over\r\nme again. When in Mr. Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s employment, I was kept in such a\r\nperpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, but\r\nmy life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty. I have\r\nobserved this in my experience of slavery,\xe2\x80\x94that whenever my condition\r\nwas improved, instead of its increasing my contentment, it only\r\nincreased my desire to be free, and set me to thinking of plans to gain\r\nmy freedom. I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is\r\nnecessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his\r\nmoral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the\r\npower of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in\r\nslavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be\r\nbrought to that only when he ceases to be a man.\r\n\r\nI was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day.\r\nI contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully\r\nmy own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to\r\ndeliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh. And why? Not because\r\nhe earned it,\xe2\x80\x94not because he had any hand in earning it,\xe2\x80\x94not because I\r\nowed it to him,\xe2\x80\x94nor because he possessed the slightest shadow of a\r\nright to it; but solely because he had the power to compel me to give\r\nit up. The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is\r\nexactly the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to that part of my life during which I planned, and finally\r\nsucceeded in making, my escape from slavery. But before narrating any\r\nof the peculiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make known my\r\nintention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction. My\r\nreasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following:\r\nFirst, were I to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is not\r\nonly possible, but quite probable, that others would thereby be\r\ninvolved in the most embarrassing difficulties. Secondly, such a\r\nstatement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part\r\nof slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of\r\ncourse, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother\r\nbondman might escape his galling chains. I deeply regret the necessity\r\nthat impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my\r\nexperience in slavery. It would afford me great pleasure indeed, as\r\nwell as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were I at\r\nliberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in the minds of\r\nmany, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most\r\nfortunate escape. But I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the\r\ncurious of the gratification which such a statement would afford. I\r\nwould allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which\r\nevil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and\r\nthereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a\r\nbrother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.\r\n\r\nI have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our\r\nwestern friends have conducted what they call the _underground\r\nrailroad,_ but which I think, by their open declarations, has been made\r\nmost emphatically the _upperground railroad._ I honor those good men\r\nand women for their noble daring, and applaud them for willingly\r\nsubjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their\r\nparticipation in the escape of slaves. I, however, can see very little\r\ngood resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves\r\nescaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that those\r\nopen declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are\r\nseeking to escape. They do nothing towards enlightening the slave,\r\nwhilst they do much towards enlightening the master. They stimulate him\r\nto greater watchfulness, and enhance his power to capture his slave. We\r\nowe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north\r\nof it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be\r\ncareful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from\r\nescaping from slavery. I would keep the merciless slaveholder\r\nprofoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. I\r\nwould leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible\r\ntormentors, ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling\r\nprey. Let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let darkness\r\ncommensurate with his crime hover over him; and let him feel that at\r\nevery step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he is running\r\nthe frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible\r\nagency. Let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by\r\nwhich he can trace the footprints of our flying brother. But enough of\r\nthis. I will now proceed to the statement of those facts, connected\r\nwith my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and for which no one\r\ncan be made to suffer but myself.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1838, I became quite restless. I could\r\nsee no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of\r\nmy toil into the purse of my master. When I carried to him my weekly\r\nwages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a\r\nrobber-like fierceness, and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this all?\xe2\x80\x9d He was satisfied with\r\nnothing less than the last cent. He would, however, when I made him six\r\ndollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the\r\nopposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to\r\nthe whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to\r\nmy mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. I always\r\nfelt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving\r\nme a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to\r\nbe a pretty honorable sort of robber. My discontent grew upon me. I was\r\never on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means,\r\nI determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with\r\nwhich to make my escape. In the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came\r\nto Baltimore to purchase his spring goods, I got an opportunity, and\r\napplied to him to allow me to hire my time. He unhesitatingly refused\r\nmy request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape.\r\nHe told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in\r\nthe event of my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts\r\nto catch me. He exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. He told\r\nme, if I would be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future. He\r\nsaid, if I behaved myself properly, he would take care of me. Indeed,\r\nhe advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me\r\nto depend solely upon him for happiness. He seemed to see fully the\r\npressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to\r\ncontentment in slavery. But in spite of him, and even in spite of\r\nmyself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my\r\nenslavement, and the means of escape.\r\n\r\nAbout two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege\r\nof hiring my time. He was not acquainted with the fact that I had\r\napplied to Master Thomas, and had been refused. He too, at first,\r\nseemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he granted me\r\nthe privilege, and proposed the following terms: I was to be allowed\r\nall my time, make all contracts with those for whom I worked, and find\r\nmy own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was to pay him\r\nthree dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools,\r\nand in board and clothing. My board was two dollars and a half per\r\nweek. This, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made\r\nmy regular expenses about six dollars per week. This amount I was\r\ncompelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time.\r\nRain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must\r\nbe forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege. This arrangement, it\r\nwill be perceived, was decidedly in my master\xe2\x80\x99s favor. It relieved him\r\nof all need of looking after me. His money was sure. He received all\r\nthe benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all the\r\nevils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman. I\r\nfound it a hard bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better than\r\nthe old mode of getting along. It was a step towards freedom to be\r\nallowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined\r\nto hold on upon it. I bent myself to the work of making money. I was\r\nready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring\r\nperseverance and industry, I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay\r\nup a little money every week. I went on thus from May till August.\r\nMaster Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer. The ground\r\nfor his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay\r\nhim for my week\xe2\x80\x99s time. This failure was occasioned by my attending a\r\ncamp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore. During the week, I had\r\nentered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from\r\nBaltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening; and being detained\r\nby my employer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s without\r\ndisappointing the company. I knew that Master Hugh was in no special\r\nneed of the money that night. I therefore decided to go to camp\r\nmeeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars. I staid at the\r\ncamp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left. But as soon as\r\nI returned, I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due. I\r\nfound him very angry; he could scarce restrain his wrath. He said he\r\nhad a great mind to give me a severe whipping. He wished to know how I\r\ndared go out of the city without asking his permission. I told him I\r\nhired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it, I\r\ndid not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go.\r\nThis reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned\r\nto me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he\r\nshould know of, I would be running away. Upon the same plea, he told me\r\nto bring my tools and clothing home forthwith. I did so; but instead of\r\nseeking work, as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my\r\ntime, I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke\r\nof work. I did this in retaliation. Saturday night, he called upon me\r\nas usual for my week\xe2\x80\x99s wages. I told him I had no wages; I had done no\r\nwork that week. Here we were upon the point of coming to blows. He\r\nraved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. I did not allow\r\nmyself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his\r\nhand upon me, it should be blow for blow. He did not strike me, but\r\ntold me that he would find me in constant employment in future. I\r\nthought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally\r\nresolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would\r\nmake a second attempt to secure my freedom. I now had three weeks\r\nduring which to prepare for my journey. Early on Monday morning, before\r\nMaster Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and got\r\nemployment of Mr. Butler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon\r\nwhat is called the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him to\r\nseek employment for me. At the end of the week, I brought him between\r\neight and nine dollars. He seemed very well pleased, and asked why I\r\ndid not do the same the week before. He little knew what my plans were.\r\nMy object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might\r\nentertain of my intent to run away; and in this I succeeded admirably.\r\nI suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition\r\nthan at the very time during which I was planning my escape. The second\r\nweek passed, and again I carried him my full wages; and so well pleased\r\nwas he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a\r\nslaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. I\r\ntold him I would.\r\n\r\nThings went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was\r\ntrouble. It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of\r\nmy contemplated start drew near. I had a number of warmhearted friends\r\nin Baltimore,\xe2\x80\x94friends that I loved almost as I did my life,\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nthought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond\r\nexpression. It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery,\r\nwho now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to\r\ntheir friends. The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most\r\npainful thought with which I had to contend. The love of them was my\r\ntender point, and shook my decision more than all things else. Besides\r\nthe pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure\r\nexceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt. The appalling\r\ndefeat I then sustained returned to torment me. I felt assured that, if\r\nI failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one\xe2\x80\x94it would seal\r\nmy fate as a slave forever. I could not hope to get off with any thing\r\nless than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of\r\nescape. It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most\r\nfrightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed.\r\nThe wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were\r\nperpetually before me. It was life and death with me. But I remained\r\nfirm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of September,\r\n1838, I left my chains, and succeeded in reaching New York without the\r\nslightest interruption of any kind. How I did so,\xe2\x80\x94what means I\r\nadopted,\xe2\x80\x94what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmust leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free\r\nState. I have never been able to answer the question with any\r\nsatisfaction to myself. It was a moment of the highest excitement I\r\never experienced. I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed\r\nmariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the\r\npursuit of a pirate. In writing to a dear friend, immediately after my\r\narrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of\r\nhungry lions. This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I\r\nwas again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I\r\nwas yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of\r\nslavery. This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm.\r\nBut the loneliness overcame me. There I was in the midst of thousands,\r\nand yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the\r\nmidst of thousands of my own brethren\xe2\x80\x94children of a common Father, and\r\nyet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition. I was\r\nafraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and\r\nthereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose\r\nbusiness it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the\r\nferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey. The motto\r\nwhich I adopted when I started from slavery was this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTrust no man!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause\r\nfor distrust. It was a most painful situation; and, to understand it,\r\none must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar\r\ncircumstances. Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land\xe2\x80\x94a land\r\ngiven up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders\xe2\x80\x94whose inhabitants\r\nare legalized kidnappers\xe2\x80\x94where he is every moment subjected to the\r\nterrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen, as the\r\nhideous crocodile seizes upon his prey!\xe2\x80\x94I say, let him place himself in\r\nmy situation\xe2\x80\x94without home or friends\xe2\x80\x94without money or credit\xe2\x80\x94wanting\r\nshelter, and no one to give it\xe2\x80\x94wanting bread, and no money to buy\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless\r\nmen-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or\r\nwhere to stay,\xe2\x80\x94perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and\r\nmeans of escape,\xe2\x80\x94in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible\r\ngnawings of hunger,\xe2\x80\x94in the midst of houses, yet having no home,\xe2\x80\x94among\r\nfellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose\r\ngreediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is\r\nonly equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up\r\nthe helpless fish upon which they subsist,\xe2\x80\x94I say, let him be placed in\r\nthis most trying situation,\xe2\x80\x94the situation in which I was placed,\xe2\x80\x94then,\r\nand not till then, will he fully appreciate the hardships of, and know\r\nhow to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven, I remained but a short time in this distressed situation.\r\nI was relieved from it by the humane hand of _Mr. David Ruggles_, whose\r\nvigilance, kindness, and perseverance, I shall never forget. I am glad\r\nof an opportunity to express, as far as words can, the love and\r\ngratitude I bear him. Mr. Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness, and\r\nis himself in need of the same kind offices which he was once so\r\nforward in the performance of toward others. I had been in New York but\r\na few days, when Mr. Ruggles sought me out, and very kindly took me to\r\nhis boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets. Mr.\r\nRuggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable _Darg_ case, as\r\nwell as attending to a number of other fugitive slaves, devising ways\r\nand means for their successful escape; and, though watched and hemmed\r\nin on almost every side, he seemed to be more than a match for his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nVery soon after I went to Mr. Ruggles, he wished to know of me where I\r\nwanted to go; as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York. I\r\ntold him I was a calker, and should like to go where I could get work.\r\nI thought of going to Canada; but he decided against it, and in favor\r\nof my going to New Bedford, thinking I should be able to get work there\r\nat my trade. At this time, Anna,[2] my intended wife, came on; for I\r\nwrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York, (notwithstanding\r\nmy homeless, houseless, and helpless condition,) informing her of my\r\nsuccessful flight, and wishing her to come on forthwith. In a few days\r\nafter her arrival, Mr. Ruggles called in the Rev. J. W. C. Pennington,\r\nwho, in the presence of Mr. Ruggles, Mrs. Michaels, and two or three\r\nothers, performed the marriage ceremony, and gave us a certificate, of\r\nwhich the following is an exact copy:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis may certify, that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick\r\nJohnson[3] and Anna Murray, as man and wife, in the presence of Mr.\r\nDavid Ruggles and Mrs. Michaels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJAMES W. C. PENNINGTON\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_New York, Sept_. 15, 1838\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] She was free.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I had changed my name from Frederick _Bailey_ to that of\r\n _Johnson_.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon receiving this certificate, and a five-dollar bill from Mr.\r\nRuggles, I shouldered one part of our baggage, and Anna took up the\r\nother, and we set out forthwith to take passage on board of the\r\nsteamboat John W. Richmond for Newport, on our way to New Bedford. Mr.\r\nRuggles gave me a letter to a Mr. Shaw in Newport, and told me, in case\r\nmy money did not serve me to New Bedford, to stop in Newport and obtain\r\nfurther assistance; but upon our arrival at Newport, we were so anxious\r\nto get to a place of safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked the\r\nnecessary money to pay our fare, we decided to take seats in the stage,\r\nand promise to pay when we got to New Bedford. We were encouraged to do\r\nthis by two excellent gentlemen, residents of New Bedford, whose names\r\nI afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C. Taber.\r\nThey seemed at once to understand our circumstances, and gave us such\r\nassurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nIt was good indeed to meet with such friends, at such a time. Upon\r\nreaching New Bedford, we were directed to the house of Mr. Nathan\r\nJohnson, by whom we were kindly received, and hospitably provided for.\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Johnson took a deep and lively interest in our\r\nwelfare. They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of\r\nabolitionists. When the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare,\r\nhe held on upon our baggage as security for the debt. I had but to\r\nmention the fact to Mr. Johnson, and he forthwith advanced the money.\r\n\r\nWe now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for\r\nthe duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom. On the morning\r\nafter our arrival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the\r\nquestion arose as to what name I should be called by. The name given me\r\nby my mother was, \xe2\x80\x9cFrederick Augustus Washington Bailey.\xe2\x80\x9d I, however,\r\nhad dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so\r\nthat I was generally known by the name of \xe2\x80\x9cFrederick Bailey.\xe2\x80\x9d I started\r\nfrom Baltimore bearing the name of \xe2\x80\x9cStanley.\xe2\x80\x9d When I got to New York, I\r\nagain changed my name to \xe2\x80\x9cFrederick Johnson,\xe2\x80\x9d and thought that would be\r\nthe last change. But when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary\r\nagain to change my name. The reason of this necessity was, that there\r\nwere so many Johnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to\r\ndistinguish between them. I gave Mr. Johnson the privilege of choosing\r\nme a name, but told him he must not take from me the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrederick.\xe2\x80\x9d I must hold on to that, to preserve a sense of my\r\nidentity. Mr. Johnson had just been reading the \xe2\x80\x9cLady of the Lake,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nat once suggested that my name be \xe2\x80\x9cDouglass.\xe2\x80\x9d From that time until now\r\nI have been called \xe2\x80\x9cFrederick Douglass;\xe2\x80\x9d and as I am more widely known\r\nby that name than by either of the others, I shall continue to use it\r\nas my own.\r\n\r\nI was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New\r\nBedford. The impression which I had received respecting the character\r\nand condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly\r\nerroneous. I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of\r\nthe comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at\r\nthe north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the\r\nsouth. I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern\r\npeople owned no slaves. I supposed that they were about upon a level\r\nwith the non-slaveholding population of the south. I knew _they_ were\r\nexceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as\r\nthe necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders. I had\r\nsomehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could\r\nbe no wealth, and very little refinement. And upon coming to the north,\r\nI expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated\r\npopulation, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing\r\nof the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. Such\r\nbeing my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New\r\nBedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the\r\nwharves, to take a view of the shipping. Here I found myself surrounded\r\nwith the strongest proofs of wealth. Lying at the wharves, and riding\r\nin the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order,\r\nand of the largest size. Upon the right and left, I was walled in by\r\ngranite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost\r\ncapacity with the necessaries and comforts of life. Added to this,\r\nalmost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared\r\nwith what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loud\r\nsongs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard\r\nno deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer. I saw no whipping of\r\nmen; but all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand\r\nhis work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which\r\nbetokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, as well\r\nas a sense of his own dignity as a man. To me this looked exceedingly\r\nstrange. From the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing\r\nwith wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful\r\ndwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth,\r\ncomfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of\r\nslaveholding Maryland.\r\n\r\nEvery thing looked clean, new, and beautiful. I saw few or no\r\ndilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked\r\nchildren and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in\r\nHillsborough, Easton, St. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s, and Baltimore. The people looked\r\nmore able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland. I\r\nwas for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being\r\nsaddened by seeing extreme poverty. But the most astonishing as well as\r\nthe most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored\r\npeople, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a\r\nrefuge from the hunters of men. I found many, who had not been seven\r\nyears out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently\r\nenjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders\r\nin Maryland. I will venture to assert, that my friend Mr. Nathan\r\nJohnson (of whom I can say with a grateful heart, \xe2\x80\x9cI was hungry, and he\r\ngave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger,\r\nand he took me in\xe2\x80\x9d) lived in a neater house; dined at a better table;\r\ntook, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral,\r\nreligious, and political character of the nation,\xe2\x80\x94than nine tenths of\r\nthe slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland. Yet Mr. Johnson was a\r\nworking man. His hands were hardened by toil, and not his alone, but\r\nthose also of Mrs. Johnson. I found the colored people much more\r\nspirited than I had supposed they would be. I found among them a\r\ndetermination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper,\r\nat all hazards. Soon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance\r\nwhich illustrated their spirit. A colored man and a fugitive slave were\r\non unfriendly terms. The former was heard to threaten the latter with\r\ninforming his master of his whereabouts. Straightway a meeting was\r\ncalled among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness of importance!\xe2\x80\x9d The betrayer was invited to attend. The\r\npeople came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by\r\nappointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe,\r\nmade a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young\r\nmen just take him outside the door, and kill him!_\xe2\x80\x9d With this, a number\r\nof them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid\r\nthan themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not\r\nbeen seen in New Bedford since. I believe there have been no more such\r\nthreats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\r\nI found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop\r\nwith a load of oil. It was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went\r\nat it with a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master. It\r\nwas a happy moment, the rapture of which can be understood only by\r\nthose who have been slaves. It was the first work, the reward of which\r\nwas to be entirely my own. There was no Master Hugh standing ready, the\r\nmoment I earned the money, to rob me of it. I worked that day with a\r\npleasure I had never before experienced. I was at work for myself and\r\nnewly-married wife. It was to me the starting-point of a new existence.\r\nWhen I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of\r\ncalking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among\r\nthe white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I\r\ncould get no employment.[4] Finding my trade of no immediate benefit, I\r\nthrew off my calking habiliments, and prepared myself to do any kind of\r\nwork I could get to do. Mr. Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse\r\nand saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of work. There was no\r\nwork too hard\xe2\x80\x94none too dirty. I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal,\r\ncarry wood, sweep the chimney, or roll oil casks,\xe2\x80\x94all of which I did\r\nfor nearly three years in New Bedford, before I became known to the\r\nanti-slavery world.\r\n\r\n [4] I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking\r\n in New Bedford\xe2\x80\x94a result of anti-slavery effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn about four months after I went to New Bedford, there came a young\r\nman to me, and inquired if I did not wish to take the \xe2\x80\x9cLiberator.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ntold him I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery, I\r\nremarked that I was unable to pay for it then. I, however, finally\r\nbecame a subscriber to it. The paper came, and I read it from week to\r\nweek with such feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to\r\ndescribe. The paper became my meat and my drink. My soul was set all on\r\nfire. Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds\xe2\x80\x94its scathing denunciations\r\nof slaveholders\xe2\x80\x94its faithful exposures of slavery\xe2\x80\x94and its powerful\r\nattacks upon the upholders of the institution\xe2\x80\x94sent a thrill of joy\r\nthrough my soul, such as I had never felt before!\r\n\r\nI had not long been a reader of the \xe2\x80\x9cLiberator,\xe2\x80\x9d before I got a pretty\r\ncorrect idea of the principles, measures and spirit of the anti-slavery\r\nreform. I took right hold of the cause. I could do but little; but what\r\nI could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt happier than when in\r\nan anti-slavery meeting. I seldom had much to say at the meetings,\r\nbecause what I wanted to say was said so much better by others. But,\r\nwhile attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the 11th of\r\nAugust, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time\r\nmuch urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman who had heard\r\nme speak in the colored people\xe2\x80\x99s meeting at New Bedford. It was a\r\nsevere cross, and I took it up reluctantly. The truth was, I felt\r\nmyself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me\r\ndown. I spoke but a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and\r\nsaid what I desired with considerable ease. From that time until now, I\r\nhave been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren\xe2\x80\x94with what\r\nsuccess, and with what devotion, I leave those acquainted with my\r\nlabors to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI find, since reading over the foregoing Narrative, that I have, in\r\nseveral instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, respecting\r\nreligion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious\r\nviews to suppose me an opponent of all religion. To remove the\r\nliability of such misapprehension, I deem it proper to append the\r\nfollowing brief explanation. What I have said respecting and against\r\nreligion, I mean strictly to apply to the _slaveholding religion_ of\r\nthis land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for,\r\nbetween the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ,\r\nI recognize the widest possible difference\xe2\x80\x94so wide, that to receive the\r\none as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as\r\nbad, corrupt, and wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity\r\nto be the enemy of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial\r\nChristianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding,\r\nwomen-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical\r\nChristianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most\r\ndeceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I\r\nlook upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds,\r\nand the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nam filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious\r\npomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every\r\nwhere surround me. We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers\r\nfor missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. The man who\r\nwields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on\r\nSunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus. The\r\nman who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a\r\nclass-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way of life, and the\r\npath of salvation. He who sells my sister, for purposes of\r\nprostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity. He who\r\nproclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of\r\nlearning to read the name of the God who made me. He who is the\r\nreligious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred\r\ninfluence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution. The\r\nwarm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that\r\nscatters whole families,\xe2\x80\x94sundering husbands and wives, parents and\r\nchildren, sisters and brothers,\xe2\x80\x94leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth\r\ndesolate. We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer\r\nagainst adultery. We have men sold to build churches, women sold to\r\nsupport the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the _Poor\r\nHeathen! All For The Glory Of God And The Good Of Souls!_ The slave\r\nauctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other,\r\nand the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the\r\nreligious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals\r\nin the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the\r\nchurch stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling\r\nof chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the\r\nchurch, may be heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies and\r\nsouls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they\r\nmutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to\r\nsupport the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal\r\nbusiness with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and\r\nrobbery the allies of each other\xe2\x80\x94devils dressed in angels\xe2\x80\x99 robes, and\r\nhell presenting the semblance of paradise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust God! and these are they,v Who minister at thine altar, God of\r\nright!\r\nMen who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay\r\nOn Israel\xe2\x80\x99s ark of light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! preach, and kidnap men?\r\nGive thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?\r\nTalk of thy glorious liberty, and then\r\nBolt hard the captive\xe2\x80\x99s door?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! servants of thy own\r\nMerciful Son, who came to seek and save\r\nThe homeless and the outcast, fettering down\r\nThe tasked and plundered slave!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPilate and Herod friends!\r\nChief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!\r\nJust God and holy! is that church which lends\r\nStrength to the spoiler thine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christianity of America is a Christianity, of whose votaries it may\r\nbe as truly said, as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nbind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their\r\nfingers. All their works they do for to be seen of men.\xe2\x80\x94They love the\r\nuppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, . . .\r\n. . . and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.\xe2\x80\x94But woe unto you, scribes\r\nand Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against\r\nmen; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are\r\nentering to go in. Ye devour widows\xe2\x80\x99 houses, and for a pretence make\r\nlong prayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Ye\r\ncompass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye\r\nmake him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.\xe2\x80\x94Woe unto you,\r\nscribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise,\r\nand cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment,\r\nmercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the\r\nother undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a\r\ncamel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make\r\nclean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but within, they are\r\nfull of extortion and excess.\xe2\x80\x94Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,\r\nhypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear\r\nbeautiful outward, but are within full of dead men\xe2\x80\x99s bones, and of all\r\nuncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but\r\nwithin ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be strictly true of\r\nthe overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America. They strain\r\nat a gnat, and swallow a camel. Could any thing be more true of our\r\nchurches? They would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a\r\n_sheep_-stealer; and at the same time they hug to their communion a\r\n_man_-stealer, and brand me with being an infidel, if I find fault with\r\nthem for it. They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward\r\nforms of religion, and at the same time neglect the weightier matters\r\nof the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. They are always ready to\r\nsacrifice, but seldom to show mercy. They are they who are represented\r\nas professing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate\r\ntheir brother whom they have seen. They love the heathen on the other\r\nside of the globe. They can pray for him, pay money to have the Bible\r\nput into his hand, and missionaries to instruct him; while they despise\r\nand totally neglect the heathen at their own doors.\r\n\r\nSuch is, very briefly, my view of the religion of this land; and to\r\navoid any misunderstanding, growing out of the use of general terms, I\r\nmean by the religion of this land, that which is revealed in the words,\r\ndeeds, and actions, of those bodies, north and south, calling\r\nthemselves Christian churches, and yet in union with slaveholders. It\r\nis against religion, as presented by these bodies, that I have felt it\r\nmy duty to testify.\r\n\r\nI conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the\r\nreligion of the south, (which is, by communion and fellowship, the\r\nreligion of the north,) which I soberly affirm is \xe2\x80\x9ctrue to the life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand without caricature or the slightest exaggeration. It is said to\r\nhave been drawn, several years before the present anti-slavery\r\nagitation began, by a northern Methodist preacher, who, while residing\r\nat the south, had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals, manners,\r\nand piety, with his own eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I not visit for these things?\r\nsaith the Lord. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nA PARODY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, saints and sinners, hear me tell\r\nHow pious priests whip Jack and Nell,\r\nAnd women buy and children sell,\r\nAnd preach all sinners down to hell,\r\nAnd sing of heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll bleat and baa, dona like goats,\r\nGorge down black sheep, and strain at motes,\r\nArray their backs in fine black coats,\r\nThen seize their negroes by their throats,\r\nAnd choke, for heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll church you if you sip a dram,\r\nAnd damn you if you steal a lamb;\r\nYet rob old Tony, Doll, and Sam,\r\nOf human rights, and bread and ham;\r\nKidnapper\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll loudly talk of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s reward,\r\nAnd bind his image with a cord,\r\nAnd scold, and swing the lash abhorred,\r\nAnd sell their brother in the Lord\r\nTo handcuffed heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll read and sing a sacred song,\r\nAnd make a prayer both loud and long,\r\nAnd teach the right and do the wrong,\r\nHailing the brother, sister throng,\r\nWith words of heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wonder how such saints can sing,\r\nOr praise the Lord upon the wing,\r\nWho roar, and scold, and whip, and sting,\r\nAnd to their slaves and mammon cling,\r\nIn guilty conscience union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll raise tobacco, corn, and rye,\r\nAnd drive, and thieve, and cheat, and lie,\r\nAnd lay up treasures in the sky,\r\nBy making switch and cowskin fly,\r\nIn hope of heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll crack old Tony on the skull,\r\nAnd preach and roar like Bashan bull,\r\nOr braying ass, of mischief full,\r\nThen seize old Jacob by the wool,\r\nAnd pull for heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA roaring, ranting, sleek man-thief,\r\nWho lived on mutton, veal, and beef,\r\nYet never would afford relief\r\nTo needy, sable sons of grief,\r\nWas big with heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Love not the world,\xe2\x80\x99 the preacher said,\r\nAnd winked his eye, and shook his head;\r\nHe seized on Tom, and Dick, and Ned,\r\nCut short their meat, and clothes, and bread,\r\nYet still loved heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother preacher whining spoke\r\nOf One whose heart for sinners broke:\r\nHe tied old Nanny to an oak,\r\nAnd drew the blood at every stroke,\r\nAnd prayed for heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo others oped their iron jaws,\r\nAnd waved their children-stealing paws;\r\nThere sat their children in gewgaws;\r\nBy stinting negroes\xe2\x80\x99 backs and maws,\r\nThey kept up heavenly union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll good from Jack another takes,\r\nAnd entertains their flirts and rakes,\r\nWho dress as sleek as glossy snakes,\r\nAnd cram their mouths with sweetened cakes;\r\nAnd this goes down for union.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something\r\ntoward throwing light on the American slave system, and hastening the\r\nglad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in\r\nbonds\xe2\x80\x94faithfully relying upon the power of truth, love, and justice,\r\nfor success in my humble efforts\xe2\x80\x94and solemnly pledging my self anew to\r\nthe sacred cause,\xe2\x80\x94I subscribe myself,\r\n\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNN, _Mass., April_ 28, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 23-0.txt or 23-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/23/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
