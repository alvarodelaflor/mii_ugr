Franklin\'s signature]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell\r\nus the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed to\r\nfind nothing but commonplace statements, or receipts that we know by\r\nheart but never follow. Most of the life stories of our famous and\r\nsuccessful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element\r\nthat makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp.\r\nWhile we are searching far and near for some Aladdin\'s Lamp to give\r\ncoveted fortune, there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out\r\nand take it, like the charm in Milton\'s _Comus_,\r\n\r\n  "Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain\r\n   Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;"\r\n\r\nthe interesting, human, and vividly told story of one of the wisest\r\nand most useful lives in our own history, and perhaps in any history.\r\nIn Franklin\'s _Autobiography_ is offered not so much a ready-made\r\nformula for success, as the companionship of a real flesh and blood\r\nman of extraordinary mind and quality, whose daily walk and\r\nconversation will help us to meet our own difficulties, much as does\r\nthe example of a wise and strong friend. While we are fascinated by\r\nthe story, we absorb the human experience through which a strong and\r\nhelpful character is building.\r\n\r\nThe thing that makes Franklin\'s _Autobiography_ different from every\r\nother life story of a great and successful man is just this human\r\naspect of the account. Franklin told the story of his life, as he\r\nhimself says, for the benefit of his posterity. He wanted to help them\r\nby the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence\r\nand wealth. He is not unmindful of the importance of his public\r\nservices and their recognition, yet his accounts of these achievements\r\nare given only as a part of the story, and the vanity displayed is\r\nincidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital. There is\r\nnothing of the impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as he\r\nsets them forth. The youth who reads the fascinating story is\r\nastonished to find that Franklin in his early years struggled with the\r\nsame everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences,\r\nand he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a\r\nrealization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons why the _Autobiography_ should be an intimate\r\nfriend of American young people. Here they may establish a close\r\nrelationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of the\r\nwisest men of his age.\r\n\r\nThe life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance to every American\r\nprimarily because of the part he played in securing the independence\r\nof the United States and in establishing it as a nation. Franklin\r\nshares with Washington the honors of the Revolution, and of the events\r\nleading to the birth of the new nation. While Washington was the\r\nanimating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, Franklin was its\r\nablest champion abroad. To Franklin\'s cogent reasoning and keen\r\nsatire, we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the American\r\ncase in England and France; while to his personality and diplomacy as\r\nwell as to his facile pen, we are indebted for the foreign alliance\r\nand the funds without which Washington\'s work must have failed. His\r\npatience, fortitude, and practical wisdom, coupled with\r\nself-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country, are hardly less\r\nnoticeable than similar qualities displayed by Washington. In fact,\r\nFranklin as a public man was much like Washington, especially in the\r\nentire disinterestedness of his public service.\r\n\r\nFranklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings\r\nhe has done more than any other American to advance the material\r\nprosperity of his countrymen. It is said that his widely and\r\nfaithfully read maxims made Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy,\r\nwhile Poor Richard\'s pithy sayings, translated into many languages,\r\nhave had a world-wide influence.\r\n\r\nFranklin is a good type of our American manhood. Although not the\r\nwealthiest or the most powerful, he is undoubtedly, in the versatility\r\nof his genius and achievements, the greatest of our self-made men. The\r\nsimple yet graphic story in the _Autobiography_ of his steady rise\r\nfrom humble boyhood in a tallow-chandler shop, by industry, economy,\r\nand perseverance in self-improvement, to eminence, is the most\r\nremarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men. It is\r\nin itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be\r\nattained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklin\'s\r\nmaxims.\r\n\r\nFranklin\'s fame, however, was not confined to his own country.\r\nAlthough he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of\r\nscientific and political thought and activity, yet no less a keen\r\njudge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor of the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, a century ago said that "in one point of view\r\nthe name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of\r\nthe others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished as\r\na statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting in\r\nhimself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excel\r\nin either of which is deemed the highest praise."\r\n\r\nFranklin has indeed been aptly called "many-sided." He was eminent in\r\nscience and public service, in diplomacy and in literature. He was the\r\nEdison of his day, turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit\r\nof his fellow-men. He perceived the identity of lightning and\r\nelectricity and set up the lightning rod. He invented the Franklin\r\nstove, still widely used, and refused to patent it. He possessed a\r\nmasterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs. Carlyle called\r\nhim the father of all the Yankees. He founded a fire company, assisted\r\nin founding a hospital, and improved the cleaning and lighting of\r\nstreets. He developed journalism, established the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, the public library in Philadelphia, and the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He organized a postal system for the\r\ncolonies, which was the basis of the present United States Post\r\nOffice. Bancroft, the eminent historian, called him "the greatest\r\ndiplomatist of his century." He perfected the Albany Plan of Union for\r\nthe colonies. He is the only statesman who signed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peace\r\nwith England, and the Constitution. As a writer, he has produced, in\r\nhis _Autobiography_ and in _Poor Richard\'s Almanac_, two works that\r\nare not surpassed by similar writing. He received honorary degrees\r\nfrom Harvard and Yale, from Oxford and St. Andrews, and was made a\r\nfellow of the Royal Society, which awarded him the Copley gold medal\r\nfor improving natural knowledge. He was one of the eight foreign\r\nassociates of the French Academy of Science.\r\n\r\nThe careful study of the _Autobiography_ is also valuable because of\r\nthe style in which it is written. If Robert Louis Stevenson is right\r\nin believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then\r\nthe youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly,\r\nforcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklin\'s\r\nmethod. Franklin\'s fame in the scientific world was due almost as much\r\nto his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting his\r\ndiscoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which\r\nhe described his experiments, as to the results he was able to\r\nannounce. Sir Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself an\r\nexcellent literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: "A\r\nsingular felicity guided all Franklin\'s researches, and by very small\r\nmeans he established very grand truths. The style and manner of his\r\npublication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the\r\ndoctrine it contains."\r\n\r\nFranklin\'s place in literature is hard to determine because he was not\r\nprimarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life work\r\nwas to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an end\r\nin itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as a\r\nscientist, a statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in no\r\nlittle part due to his ability as a writer. "His letters charmed all,\r\nand made his correspondence eagerly sought. His political arguments\r\nwere the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents. His\r\nscientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple\r\nand so clear that plow-boy and exquisite could follow his thought or\r\nhis experiment to its conclusion."[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _The Many-Sided Franklin._ Paul L. Ford.\r\n\r\nAs far as American literature is concerned, Franklin has no\r\ncontemporaries. Before the _Autobiography_ only one literary work of\r\nimportance had been produced in this country--Cotton Mather\'s\r\n_Magnalia_, a church history of New England in a ponderous, stiff\r\nstyle. Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide and\r\npermanent reputation in Europe. The _Autobiography_, _Poor Richard_,\r\n_Father Abraham\'s Speech_ or _The Way to Wealth_, as well as some of\r\nthe _Bagatelles_, are as widely known abroad as any American writings.\r\nFranklin must also be classed as the first American humorist.\r\n\r\nEnglish literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the\r\ndevelopment of prose. Periodical literature reached its perfection\r\nearly in the century in _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_ of Addison\r\nand Steele. Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period. The\r\nhomelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the more\r\nelegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson, who set the\r\nstandard for prose writing from 1745 onward. This century saw the\r\nbeginnings of the modern novel, in Fielding\'s _Tom Jones_,\r\nRichardson\'s _Clarissa Harlowe_, Sterne\'s _Tristram Shandy_, and\r\nGoldsmith\'s _Vicar of Wakefield_. Gibbon wrote _The Decline and Fall\r\nof the Roman Empire_, Hume his _History of England_, and Adam Smith\r\nthe _Wealth of Nations_.\r\n\r\nIn the simplicity and vigor of his style Franklin more nearly\r\nresembles the earlier group of writers. In his first essays he was not\r\nan inferior imitator of Addison. In his numerous parables, moral\r\nallegories, and apologues he showed Bunyan\'s influence. But Franklin\r\nwas essentially a journalist. In his swift, terse style, he is most\r\nlike Defoe, who was the first great English journalist and master of\r\nthe newspaper narrative. The style of both writers is marked by\r\nhomely, vigorous expression, satire, burlesque, repartee. Here the\r\ncomparison must end. Defoe and his contemporaries were authors. Their\r\nvocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or\r\ncreative power they displayed. To authorship Franklin laid no claim.\r\nHe wrote no work of the imagination. He developed only incidentally a\r\nstyle in many respects as remarkable as that of his English\r\ncontemporaries. He wrote the best autobiography in existence, one of\r\nthe most widely known collections of maxims, and an unsurpassed series\r\nof political and social satires, because he was a man of unusual scope\r\nof power and usefulness, who knew how to tell his fellow-men the\r\nsecrets of that power and that usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story of the Autobiography\r\n\r\nThe account of how Franklin\'s _Autobiography_ came to be written and\r\nof the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an\r\ninteresting story. The _Autobiography_ is Franklin\'s longest work,\r\nand yet it is only a fragment. The first part, written as a letter to\r\nhis son, William Franklin, was not intended for publication; and the\r\ncomposition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in\r\nthe second part, from 1730 on, which was written with a view to\r\npublication. The entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision.\r\nIn fact, the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson,\r\nWilliam Temple Franklin, in editing the work changed some of the\r\nphrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar.\r\n\r\nFranklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend,\r\nBishop Shipley, at Twyford, in Hampshire, southern England, in 1771.\r\nHe took the manuscript, completed to 1731, with him when he returned\r\nto Philadelphia in 1775. It was left there with his other papers when\r\nhe went to France in the following year, and disappeared during the\r\nconfusion incident to the Revolution. Twenty-three pages of closely\r\nwritten manuscript fell into the hands of Abel James, an old friend,\r\nwho sent a copy to Franklin at Passy, near Paris, urging him to\r\ncomplete the story. Franklin took up the work at Passy in 1784 and\r\ncarried the narrative forward a few months. He changed the plan to\r\nmeet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader. His work\r\nwas soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788, when he was at\r\nhome in Philadelphia. He was now old, infirm, and suffering, and was\r\nstill engaged in public service. Under these discouraging conditions\r\nthe work progressed slowly. It finally stopped when the narrative\r\nreached the year 1757. Copies of the manuscript were sent to friends\r\nof Franklin in England and France, among others to Monsieur Le\r\nVeillard at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the _Autobiography_ was published in French at\r\nParis in 1791. It was clumsily and carelessly translated, and was\r\nimperfect and unfinished. Where the translator got the manuscript is\r\nnot known. Le Veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication.\r\nFrom this faulty French edition many others were printed, some in\r\nGermany, two in England, and another in France, so great was the\r\ndemand for the work.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the original manuscript of the _Autobiography_ had\r\nstarted on a varied and adventurous career. It was left by Franklin\r\nwith his other works to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, whom\r\nFranklin designated as his literary executor. When Temple Franklin\r\ncame to publish his grandfather\'s works in 1817, he sent the original\r\nmanuscript of the _Autobiography_ to the daughter of Le Veillard in\r\nexchange for her father\'s copy, probably thinking the clearer\r\ntranscript would make better printer\'s copy. The original manuscript\r\nthus found its way to the Le Veillard family and connections, where it\r\nremained until sold in 1867 to Mr. John Bigelow, United States\r\nMinister to France. By him it was later sold to Mr. E. Dwight Church\r\nof New York, and passed with the rest of Mr. Church\'s library into the\r\npossession of Mr. Henry E. Huntington. The original manuscript of\r\nFranklin\'s _Autobiography_ now rests in the vault in Mr. Huntington\'s\r\nresidence at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street, New York City.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bigelow came to examine his purchase, he was astonished to\r\nfind that what people had been reading for years as the authentic\r\n_Life of Benjamin Franklin by Himself_, was only a garbled and\r\nincomplete version of the real _Autobiography_. Temple Franklin had\r\ntaken unwarranted liberties with the original. Mr. Bigelow says he\r\nfound more than twelve hundred changes in the text. In 1868,\r\ntherefore, Mr. Bigelow published the standard edition of Franklin\'s\r\n_Autobiography_. It corrected errors in the previous editions and was\r\nthe first English edition to contain the short fourth part,\r\ncomprising the last few pages of the manuscript, written during the\r\nlast year of Franklin\'s life. Mr. Bigelow republished the\r\n_Autobiography_, with additional interesting matter, in three volumes\r\nin 1875, in 1905, and in 1910. The text in this volume is that of Mr.\r\nBigelow\'s editions.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] For the division into chapters and the chapter\r\n    titles, however, the present editor is responsible.\r\n\r\nThe _Autobiography_ has been reprinted in the United States many\r\nscores of times and translated into all the languages of Europe. It\r\nhas never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at\r\ncirculating libraries. The reason for this popularity is not far to\r\nseek. For in this work Franklin told in a remarkable manner the story\r\nof a remarkable life. He displayed hard common sense and a practical\r\nknowledge of the art of living. He selected and arranged his material,\r\nperhaps unconsciously, with the unerring instinct of the journalist\r\nfor the best effects. His success is not a little due to his plain,\r\nclear, vigorous English. He used short sentences and words, homely\r\nexpressions, apt illustrations, and pointed allusions. Franklin had a\r\nmost interesting, varied, and unusual life. He was one of the greatest\r\nconversationalists of his time.\r\n\r\nHis book is the record of that unusual life told in Franklin\'s own\r\nunexcelled conversational style. It is said that the best parts of\r\nBoswell\'s famous biography of Samuel Johnson are those parts where\r\nBoswell permits Johnson to tell his own story. In the _Autobiography_\r\na no less remarkable man and talker than Samuel Johnson is telling his\r\nown story throughout.\r\n\r\nF. W.

You may remember the inquiries I made among the\r\nremains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the\r\njourney I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally\r\nagreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which\r\nyou are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week\'s\r\nuninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to\r\nwrite them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements.\r\nHaving emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and\r\nbred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the\r\nworld, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share\r\nof felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the\r\nblessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as\r\nthey may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and\r\ntherefore fit to be imitated.\r\n\r\n    [3] A small village not far from Winchester in\r\n    Hampshire, southern England. Here was the country seat\r\n    of the Bishop of St. Asaph, Dr. Jonathan Shipley, the\r\n    "good Bishop," as Dr. Franklin used to style him. Their\r\n    relations were intimate and confidential. In his pulpit,\r\n    and in the House of Lords, as well as in society, the\r\n    bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the Crown\r\n    toward the Colonies.--Bigelow.\r\n\r\nThat felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to\r\nsay, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to\r\na repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the\r\nadvantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of\r\nthe first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some\r\nsinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable. But\r\nthough this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a\r\nrepetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living\r\none\'s life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to\r\nmake that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nHereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to\r\nbe talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall\r\nindulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to\r\nage, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since\r\nthis may be read or not as anyone pleases. And, lastly (I may as well\r\nconfess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps\r\nI shall a good deal gratify my own _vanity_.[4] Indeed, I scarce ever\r\nheard or saw the introductory words, "_Without vanity I may say_,"\r\netc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike\r\nvanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I\r\ngive it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it\r\nis often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are\r\nwithin his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would\r\nnot be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity\r\namong the other comforts of life.\r\n\r\n    [4] In this connection Woodrow Wilson says, "And yet the\r\n    surprising and delightful thing about this book (the\r\n    _Autobiography_) is that, take it all in all, it has not\r\n    the low tone of conceit, but is a staunch man\'s sober\r\n    and unaffected assessment of himself and the\r\n    circumstances of his career."\r\n\r\n    Gibbon and Hume, the great British historians, who were\r\n    contemporaries of Franklin, express in their\r\n    autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of\r\n    just self-praise.\r\n\r\nAnd now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to\r\nacknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His\r\nkind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them\r\nsuccess. My belief of this induces me to _hope_, though I must not\r\n_presume_, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me,\r\nin continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse,\r\nwhich I may experience as others have done; the complexion of my\r\nfuture fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless\r\nto us even our afflictions.\r\n\r\nThe notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in\r\ncollecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with\r\nseveral particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I\r\nlearned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in\r\nNorthamptonshire,[5] for three hundred years, and how much longer he\r\nknew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before\r\nwas the name of an order of people,[6] was assumed by them as a\r\nsurname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold\r\nof about thirty acres, aided by the smith\'s business, which had\r\ncontinued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always\r\nbred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to\r\ntheir eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an\r\naccount of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555\r\nonly, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time\r\npreceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of\r\nthe youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who\r\nwas born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow\r\nbusiness longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at\r\nBanbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.\r\nThere my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in\r\n1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it\r\nwith the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband,\r\none Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the\r\nmanor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas,\r\nJohn, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them\r\nat this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my\r\nabsence, you will among them find many more particulars.\r\n\r\n    [5] See _Introduction_.\r\n\r\n    [6] A small landowner.\r\n\r\nThomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and\r\nencouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer,\r\nthen the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for\r\nthe business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county;\r\nwas a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county\r\nor town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances\r\nwere related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the\r\nthen Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style,[7] just four\r\nyears to a day before I was born. The account we received of his life\r\nand character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as\r\nsomething extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.\r\n"Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed a\r\ntransmigration."\r\n\r\n    [7] January 17, new style. This change in the calendar\r\n    was made in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, and adopted in\r\n    England in 1752. Every year whose number in the common\r\n    reckoning since Christ is not divisible by 4, as well as\r\n    every year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by\r\n    400, shall have 365 days, and all other years shall have\r\n    366 days. In the eighteenth century there was a\r\n    difference of eleven days between the old and the new\r\n    style of reckoning, which the English Parliament\r\n    canceled by making the 3rd of September, 1752, the 14th.\r\n    The Julian calendar, or "old style," is still retained\r\n    in Russia and Greece, whose dates consequently are now\r\n    13 days behind those of other Christian countries.\r\n\r\nJohn was bred a dyer, I believe of woollens, Benjamin was bred a silk\r\ndyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. I\r\nremember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in\r\nBoston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a\r\ngreat age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left\r\nbehind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of\r\nlittle occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of\r\nwhich the following, sent to me, is a specimen.[8] He had formed a\r\nshort-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I\r\nhave now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a\r\nparticular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a\r\ngreat attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in\r\nhis short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also\r\nmuch of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell\r\nlately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the\r\nprincipal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717;\r\nmany of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but\r\nthere still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto\r\nand in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by\r\nmy sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle\r\nmust have left them here when he went to America, which was about\r\nfifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.\r\n\r\n    [8] The specimen is not in the manuscript of the\r\n    _Autobiography_.\r\n\r\nThis obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and\r\ncontinued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were\r\nsometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against\r\npopery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it,\r\nit was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a\r\njoint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he\r\nturned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then\r\nunder the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice\r\nif he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual\r\ncourt. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet,\r\nwhen the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I\r\nhad from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of\r\nEngland till about the end of Charles the Second\'s reign, when some of\r\nthe ministers that had been outed for non-conformity, holding\r\nconventicles[9] in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to\r\nthem, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family\r\nremained with the Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\n    [9] Secret gatherings of dissenters from the established\r\n    Church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birthplace of Franklin. Milk Street, Boston.]\r\n\r\nJosiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three\r\nchildren into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been\r\nforbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable\r\nmen of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was\r\nprevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy\r\ntheir mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four\r\nchildren more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all\r\nseventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his\r\ntable, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the\r\nyoungest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston,\r\nNew England.[10] My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,\r\ndaughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of\r\nwhom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather,[11] in his church\r\nhistory of that country, entitled _Magnalia Christi Americana_, as "_a\r\ngodly, learned Englishman_," if I remember the words rightly. I have\r\nheard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of\r\nthem was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in\r\n1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed to\r\nthose then concerned in the government there. It was in favour of\r\nliberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and\r\nother sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian\r\nwars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that\r\npersecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an\r\noffense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole\r\nappeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and\r\nmanly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have\r\nforgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was,\r\nthat his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would\r\nbe known to be the author.\r\n\r\n  "Because to be a libeller (says he)\r\n    I hate it with my heart;\r\n  From Sherburne town,[12] where now I dwell\r\n    My name I do put here;\r\n  Without offense your real friend,\r\n    It is Peter Folgier."\r\n\r\n    [10] Franklin was born on Sunday, January 6, old style,\r\n    1706, in a house on Milk Street, opposite the Old South\r\n    Meeting House, where he was baptized on the day of his\r\n    birth, during a snowstorm. The house where he was born\r\n    was burned in 1810.--Griffin.\r\n\r\n    [11] Cotton Mather (1663-1728), clergyman, author, and\r\n    scholar. Pastor of the North Church, Boston. He took an\r\n    active part in the persecution of witchcraft.\r\n\r\n    [12] Nantucket.\r\n\r\nMy elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was\r\nput to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending\r\nto devote me, as the tithe[13] of his sons, to the service of the\r\nChurch. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been\r\nvery early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the\r\nopinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good\r\nscholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin,\r\ntoo, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-hand\r\nvolumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would\r\nlearn his character.[14] I continued, however, at the grammar-school\r\nnot quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the\r\nmiddle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther was\r\nremoved into the next class above it, in order to go with that into\r\nthe third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from\r\na view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a\r\nfamily he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated\r\nwere afterwards able to obtain--reasons that he gave to his friends in\r\nmy hearing--altered his first intention, took me from the\r\ngrammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic,\r\nkept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in\r\nhis profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under\r\nhim I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the\r\narithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken\r\nhome to assist my father in his business, which was that of a\r\ntallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but\r\nhad assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dyeing\r\ntrade would not maintain his family, being in little request.\r\nAccordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling\r\nthe dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles, attending the shop,\r\ngoing of errands, etc.\r\n\r\n    [13] Tenth.\r\n\r\n    [14] System of short-hand.\r\n\r\nI disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my\r\nfather declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much\r\nin and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and\r\nwhen in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to\r\ngovern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions\r\nI was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into\r\nscrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early\r\nprojecting public spirit, tho\' not then justly conducted.\r\n\r\nThere was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge\r\nof which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much\r\ntrampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a\r\nwharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large\r\nheap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh,\r\nand which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the\r\nevening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my\r\nplayfellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets,\r\nsometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built\r\nour little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at\r\nmissing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made\r\nafter the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of\r\nus were corrected by our fathers; and, though I pleaded the usefulness\r\nof the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\nI think you may like to know something of his person and character. He\r\nhad an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well\r\nset, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was\r\nskilled a little in music, and had a clear, pleasing voice, so that\r\nwhen he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he\r\nsometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it\r\nwas extremely agreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and,\r\non occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen\'s tools; but\r\nhis great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment\r\nin prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs. In the\r\nlatter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to\r\neducate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to\r\nhis trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading\r\npeople, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of\r\nthe church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his\r\njudgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons\r\nabout their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently\r\nchosen an arbitrator between contending parties. At his table he liked\r\nto have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to\r\nconverse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful\r\ntopic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his\r\nchildren. By this means he turned our attention to what was good,\r\njust, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was\r\never taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it\r\nwas well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor,\r\npreferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so\r\nthat I was bro\'t up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as\r\nto be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so\r\nunobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a\r\nfew hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience\r\nto me in traveling, where my companions have been sometimes very\r\nunhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,\r\nbecause better instructed, tastes and appetites.\r\n\r\nMy mother had likewise an excellent constitution: she suckled all her\r\nten children. I never knew either my father or mother to have any\r\nsickness but that of which they dy\'d, he at 89, and she at 85 years of\r\nage. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since\r\nplaced a marble over their grave,[15] with this inscription:\r\n\r\n                     Josiah Franklin,\r\n                           and\r\n                     Abiah his wife,\r\n                   lie here interred.\r\n         They lived lovingly together in wedlock\r\n                    fifty-five years.\r\n       Without an estate, or any gainful employment,\r\n             By constant labor and industry,\r\n                  with God\'s blessing,\r\n             They maintained a large family\r\n                      comfortably,\r\n            and brought up thirteen children\r\n                 and seven grandchildren\r\n                       reputably.\r\n               From this instance, reader,\r\n        Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling,\r\n               And distrust not Providence.\r\n             He was a pious and prudent man;\r\n           She, a discreet and virtuous woman.\r\n                 Their youngest son,\r\n            In filial regard to their memory,\r\n                  Places this stone.\r\n          J. F. born 1655, died 1744, \xc3\x86tat 89.\r\n          A. F. born 1667, died 1752,----85.\r\n\r\n    [15] This marble having decayed, the citizens of Boston\r\n    in 1827 erected in its place a granite obelisk,\r\n    twenty-one feet high, bearing the original inscription\r\n    quoted in the text and another explaining the erection\r\n    of the monument.\r\n\r\nBy my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old. I us\'d\r\nto write more methodically. But one does not dress for private company\r\nas for a publick ball. \'Tis perhaps only negligence.\r\n\r\nTo return: I continued thus employed in my father\'s business for two\r\nyears, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who\r\nwas bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up\r\nfor himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was\r\ndestined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler. But my\r\ndislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions\r\nthat if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away\r\nand get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. He\r\ntherefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,\r\nbricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might\r\nobserve my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other\r\non land. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen\r\nhandle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so\r\nmuch by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a\r\nworkman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines for\r\nmy experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh\r\nand warm in my mind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler\'s trade,\r\nand my uncle Benjamin\'s son Samuel, who was bred to that business in\r\nLondon, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be\r\nwith him some time on liking. But his expectations of a fee with me\r\ndispleasing my father, I was taken home again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBEGINNING LIFE AS A PRINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came\r\ninto my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the _Pilgrim\'s\r\nProgress_, my first collection was of John Bunyan\'s works in separate\r\nlittle volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton\'s\r\n_Historical Collections_; they were small chapmen\'s books,[16] and\r\ncheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father\'s little library consisted chiefly\r\nof books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since\r\noften regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for\r\nknowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was\r\nnow resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch\'s _Lives_ there was\r\nin which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great\r\nadvantage. There was also a book of DeFoe\'s, called an _Essay on\r\nProjects_, and another of Dr. Mather\'s, called _Essays to do Good_,\r\nwhich perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on\r\nsome of the principal future events of my life.\r\n\r\n    [16] Small books, sold by chapmen or peddlers.\r\n\r\nThis bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a\r\nprinter, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In\r\n1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters\r\nto set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of\r\nmy father, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent the\r\napprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to\r\nhave me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was\r\npersuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years\r\nold. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of\r\nage, only I was to be allowed journeyman\'s wages during the last year.\r\nIn a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became\r\na useful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An\r\nacquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes\r\nto borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.\r\nOften I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when\r\nthe book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the\r\nmorning, lest it should be missed or wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who\r\nhad a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our\r\nprinting-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and\r\nvery kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now took a fancy\r\nto poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might\r\nturn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional\r\nballads. One was called _The Lighthouse Tragedy_, and contained an\r\naccount of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:\r\nthe other was a sailor\'s song, on the taking of _Teach_ (or\r\nBlackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in the\r\nGrub-street-ballad style;[17] and when they were printed he sent me\r\nabout the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event\r\nbeing recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity; but\r\nmy father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me\r\nverse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most\r\nprobably a very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use to\r\nme in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my\r\nadvancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired\r\nwhat little ability I have in that way.\r\n\r\n    [17] Grub-street: famous in English literature as the\r\n    home of poor writers.\r\n\r\nThere was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with\r\nwhom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fond\r\nwe were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another,\r\nwhich disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad\r\nhabit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the\r\ncontradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,\r\nbesides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of\r\ndisgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for\r\nfriendship. I had caught it by reading my father\'s books of dispute\r\nabout religion. Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom\r\nfall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts\r\nthat have been bred at Edinborough.\r\n\r\nA question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,\r\nof the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their\r\nabilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and that\r\nthey were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a\r\nlittle for dispute\'s sake. He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready\r\nplenty of words, and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his\r\nfluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without\r\nsettling the point, and were not to see one another again for some\r\ntime, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair\r\nand sent to him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of\r\na side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read\r\nthem. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk\r\nto me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the\r\nadvantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I\r\now\'d to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of\r\nexpression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by\r\nseveral instances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew\r\nmore attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I met with an odd volume of the _Spectator_.[18] It was\r\nthe third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it\r\nover and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing\r\nexcellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I\r\ntook some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in\r\neach sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at\r\nthe book, try\'d to compleat the papers again, by expressing each\r\nhinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed\r\nbefore, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I\r\ncompared my _Spectator_ with the original, discovered some of my\r\nfaults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or\r\na readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should\r\nhave acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since\r\nthe continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different\r\nlength, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme,\r\nwould have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for\r\nvariety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make\r\nme master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them\r\ninto verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the\r\nprose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections\r\nof hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce\r\nthem into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences\r\nand compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement\r\nof thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I\r\ndiscovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the\r\npleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I\r\nhad been lucky enough to improve the method of the language, and this\r\nencouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable\r\nEnglish writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time for these\r\nexercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began\r\nin the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the\r\nprinting-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance\r\non public worship which my father used to exact of me when I was under\r\nhis care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, thought I could\r\nnot, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.\r\n\r\n    [18] A daily London journal, comprising satirical essays\r\n    on social subjects, published by Addison and Steele in\r\n    1711-1712. The _Spectator_ and its predecessor, the\r\n    _Tatler_ (1709), marked the beginning of periodical\r\n    literature.\r\n\r\nWhen about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by\r\none Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it.\r\nMy brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded\r\nhimself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat\r\nflesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my\r\nsingularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon\'s manner of preparing\r\nsome of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty\r\npudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he\r\nwould give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would\r\nboard myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I\r\ncould save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for\r\nbuying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the\r\nrest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there\r\nalone, and, dispatching presently my light repast, which often was no\r\nmore than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart\r\nfrom the pastry-cook\'s, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time\r\ntill their return for study, in which I made the greater progress,\r\nfrom that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which\r\nusually attend temperance in eating and drinking.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was that, being on some occasion made asham\'d of my\r\nignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at\r\nschool, I took Cocker\'s book of Arithmetick, and went through the\r\nwhole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller\'s and Shermy\'s\r\nbooks of Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry\r\nthey contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I read\r\nabout this time Locke _On Human Understanding_,[19] and the _Art of\r\nThinking_, by Messrs. du Port Royal.[20]\r\n\r\n    [19] John Locke (1632-1704), a celebrated English\r\n    philosopher, founder of the so-called "common-sense"\r\n    school of philosophers. He drew up a constitution for\r\n    the colonists of Carolina.\r\n\r\n    [20] A noted society of scholarly and devout men\r\n    occupying the abbey of Port Royal near Paris, who\r\n    published learned works, among them the one here\r\n    referred to, better known as the _Port Royal Logic_.\r\n\r\nWhile I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English\r\ngrammar (I think it was Greenwood\'s), at the end of which there were\r\ntwo little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter\r\nfinishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic[21] method; and\r\nsoon after I procur\'d Xenophon\'s Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein\r\nthere are many instances of the same method. I was charm\'d with it,\r\nadopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,\r\nand put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from\r\nreading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points\r\nof our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and\r\nvery embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a\r\ndelight in it, practis\'d it continually, and grew very artful and\r\nexpert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into\r\nconcessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee,\r\nentangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate\r\nthemselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my\r\ncause always deserved. I continu\'d this method some few years, but\r\ngradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in\r\nterms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that\r\nmay possibly be disputed, the words _certainly_, _undoubtedly_, or any\r\nothers that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather\r\nsay, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to\r\nme, or _I should think it so or so_, for such and such reasons; or _I\r\nimagine it to be so_; or _it is so, if I am not mistaken_. This habit,\r\nI believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion\r\nto inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have\r\nbeen from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of\r\nconversation are to _inform_ or to be _informed_, to _please_ or to\r\n_persuade_, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their\r\npower of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails\r\nto disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of\r\nthose purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or\r\nreceiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a\r\npositive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may\r\nprovoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish\r\ninformation and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at\r\nthe same time express yourself as firmly fix\'d in your present\r\nopinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will\r\nprobably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by\r\nsuch a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in _pleasing_\r\nyour hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.\r\nPope[22] says, judiciously:\r\n\r\n  _"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,\r\n   And things unknown propos\'d as things forgot;"_\r\n\r\nfarther recommending to us\r\n\r\n  "To speak, tho\' sure, with seeming diffidence."\r\n\r\nAnd he might have coupled with this line that\r\nwhich he has coupled with another, I think,\r\nless properly,\r\n\r\n  "For want of modesty is want of sense."\r\n\r\nIf you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,\r\n\r\n  "Immodest words admit of no defense,\r\n   For want of modesty is want of sense."\r\n\r\nNow, is not _want of sense_ (where a man is so unfortunate as to want\r\nit) some apology for his _want of modesty_? and would not the lines\r\nstand more justly thus?\r\n\r\n  "Immodest words admit _but_ this defense,\r\n   That want of modesty is want of sense."\r\n\r\nThis, however, I should submit to better judgments.\r\n\r\n    [21] Socrates confuted his opponents in argument by\r\n    asking questions so skillfully devised that the answers\r\n    would confirm the questioner\'s position or show the\r\n    error of the opponent.\r\n\r\n    [22] Alexander Pope (1688-1744), the greatest English\r\n    poet of the first half of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nMy brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was\r\nthe second that appeared in America,[23] and was called the New England\r\nCourant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember\r\nhis being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as\r\nnot likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough\r\nfor America. At this time (1771) there are not less than\r\nfive-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after\r\nhaving worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets, I\r\nwas employed to carry the papers thro\' the streets to the customers.\r\n\r\n    [23] Franklin\'s memory does not serve him correctly here.\r\n    The _Courant_ was really the fifth newspaper established\r\n    in America, although generally called the fourth,\r\n    because the first, _Public Occurrences_, published in\r\n    Boston in 1690, was suppressed after the first issue.\r\n    Following is the order in which the other four papers\r\n    were published: _Boston News Letter_, 1704; _Boston\r\n    Gazette_, December 21, 1719; _The American Weekly\r\n    Mercury_, Philadelphia, December 22, 1719; _The New\r\n    England Courant_, 1721.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First page of The New England Courant of Dec. 4-11,\r\n1721. Reduced about one-third. From a copy in the Library of the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society.]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s note: Transcription given at the end of the text.]\r\n\r\nHe had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus\'d themselves by\r\nwriting little pieces for this paper, which gain\'d it credit and made\r\nit more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their\r\nconversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were\r\nreceived with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being\r\nstill a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing\r\nanything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to\r\ndisguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at\r\nnight under the door of the printing-house. It was found in the\r\nmorning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call\'d in\r\nas usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the\r\nexquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that,\r\nin their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of\r\nsome character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now that\r\nI was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really\r\nso very good ones as I then esteem\'d them.\r\n\r\nEncourag\'d, however, by this, I wrote and conveyed in the same way to\r\nthe press several more papers which were equally approv\'d; and I kept\r\nmy secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty\r\nwell exhausted, and then I discovered[24] it, when I began to be\r\nconsidered a little more by my brother\'s acquaintance, and in a manner\r\nthat did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason,\r\nthat it tended to make me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one\r\noccasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.\r\nThough a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his\r\napprentice, and, accordingly, expected the same services from me as he\r\nwould from another, while I thought he demean\'d me too much in some he\r\nrequir\'d of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our\r\ndisputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was\r\neither generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the\r\njudgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate,\r\nand had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking\r\nmy apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some\r\nopportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n    [24] Disclosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I was employed to carry the papers thro\' the streets\r\nto the customers"]\r\n\r\nOne of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I\r\nhave now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up,\r\ncensur\'d, and imprison\'d for a month, by the speaker\'s warrant, I\r\nsuppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken up\r\nand examin\'d before the council; but, tho\' I did not give them any\r\nsatisfaction, they contented themselves with admonishing me, and\r\ndismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound\r\nto keep his master\'s secrets.\r\n\r\nDuring my brother\'s confinement, which I resented a good deal,\r\nnotwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the\r\npaper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my\r\nbrother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an\r\nunfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and\r\nsatyr. My brother\'s discharge was accompany\'d with an order of the\r\nHouse (a very odd one), that "_James Franklin should no longer print\r\nthe paper called the New England Courant_."\r\n\r\nThere was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,\r\nwhat he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order by\r\nchanging the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences\r\nin that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be\r\nprinted for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin; and to\r\navoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still\r\nprinting it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old\r\nindenture should be return\'d to me, with a full discharge on the back\r\nof it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my\r\nservice, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term,\r\nwhich were to be kept private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however,\r\nit was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under\r\nmy name for several months.\r\n\r\nAt length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I\r\ntook upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture\r\nto produce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take this\r\nadvantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my\r\nlife; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under the\r\nimpressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged\r\nhim to bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur\'d man:\r\nperhaps I was too saucy and provoking.\r\n\r\nWhen he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting\r\nemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and\r\nspeaking to every master, who accordingly refus\'d to give me work. I\r\nthen thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there\r\nwas a printer; and I was rather inclin\'d to leave Boston when I\r\nreflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the\r\ngoverning party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly\r\nin my brother\'s case, it was likely I might, if I stay\'d, soon bring\r\nmyself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscreet disputations\r\nabout religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people\r\nas an infidel or atheist. I determin\'d on the point, but my father now\r\nsiding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go\r\nopenly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins,\r\ntherefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the\r\ncaptain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my\r\nbeing a young acquaintance of his. So I sold some of my books to raise\r\na little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fair\r\nwind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from\r\nhome, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, or\r\nknowledge of, any person in the place, and with very little money in\r\nmy pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboat]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n\r\nMy inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I might\r\nnow have gratify\'d them. But, having a trade, and supposing myself a\r\npretty good workman, I offer\'d my service to the printer in the place,\r\nold Mr. William Bradford, who had been the first printer in\r\nPennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrel of George\r\nKeith. He could give me no employment, having little to do, and help\r\nenough already; but says he, "My son at Philadelphia has lately lost\r\nhis principal hand, Aquilla Rose, by death; if you go thither, I\r\nbelieve he may employ you." Philadelphia was a hundred miles further;\r\nI set out, however, in a boat for Amboy, leaving my chest and things\r\nto follow me round by sea.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails\r\nto pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill,[25] and drove us upon\r\nLong Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too,\r\nfell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to\r\nhis shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again. His\r\nducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out\r\nof his pocket a book, which he desir\'d I would dry for him. It proved\r\nto be my old favorite author, Bunyan\'s Pilgrim\'s Progress, in Dutch,\r\nfinely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I\r\nhad ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it\r\nhas been translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose\r\nit has been more generally read than any other book, except perhaps\r\nthe Bible. Honest John was the first that I know of who mix\'d\r\nnarration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the\r\nreader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as it were,\r\nbrought into the company and present at the discourse. De Foe in his\r\nCruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship, Family Instructor, and\r\nother pieces, has imitated it with success; and Richardson[26] has done\r\nthe same in his Pamela, etc.\r\n\r\n    [25] Kill van Kull, the channel separating Staten Island\r\n    from New Jersey on the north.\r\n\r\n    [26] Samuel Richardson, the father of the English novel,\r\n    wrote _Pamela_, _Clarissa Harlowe_, and the _History of\r\n    Sir Charles Grandison_, novels published in the form of\r\n    letters.\r\n\r\nWhen we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there\r\ncould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach. So\r\nwe dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore. Some people came\r\ndown to the water edge and hallow\'d to us, as we did to them; but the\r\nwind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as\r\nto understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made\r\nsigns, and hallow\'d that they should fetch us; but they either did not\r\nunderstand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and\r\nnight coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should\r\nabate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if\r\nwe could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was\r\nstill wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak\'d\r\nthro\' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he. In this manner\r\nwe lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating the\r\nnext day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been\r\nthirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottle\r\nof filthy rum, and the water we sail\'d on being salt.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but,\r\nhaving read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a\r\nfever, I follow\'d the prescription, sweat plentifully most of the\r\nnight, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I\r\nproceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington,\r\nwhere I was told I should find boats that would carry me the rest of\r\nthe way to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It rained very hard all the day]\r\n\r\nIt rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak\'d, and by noon\r\na good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,\r\nbeginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable a\r\nfigure, too, that I found, by the questions ask\'d me, I was suspected\r\nto be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that\r\nsuspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening\r\nto an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr.\r\nBrown. He entered into conversation with me while I took some\r\nrefreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable\r\nand friendly. Our acquaintance continu\'d as long as he liv\'d. He had\r\nbeen, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was no town in\r\nEngland, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very\r\nparticular account. He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much\r\nof an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to\r\ntravesty the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. By\r\nthis means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and\r\nmight have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it\r\nnever was.\r\n\r\nAt his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach\'d\r\nBurlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boats\r\nwere gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to go\r\nbefore Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old\r\nwoman in the town, of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the\r\nwater, and ask\'d her advice. She invited me to lodge at her house till\r\na passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foot\r\ntraveling, I accepted the invitation. She understanding I was a\r\nprinter, would have had me stay at that town and follow my business,\r\nbeing ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with. She was very\r\nhospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will,\r\naccepting only of a pot of ale in return; and I thought myself fixed\r\ntill Tuesday should come. However, walking in the evening by the side\r\nof the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towards\r\nPhiladelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, as\r\nthere was no wind, we row\'d all the way; and about midnight, not\r\nhaving yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must\r\nhave passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we\r\nwere; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old\r\nfence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold,\r\nin October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the\r\ncompany knew the place to be Cooper\'s Creek, a little above\r\nPhiladelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and\r\narriv\'d there about eight or nine o\'clock on the Sunday morning, and\r\nlanded at the Market-street wharf.\r\n\r\nI have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and\r\nshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your\r\nmind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since\r\nmade there. I was in my working dress, my best clothes being to come\r\nround by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff\'d out\r\nwith shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for\r\nlodging. I was fatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest, I\r\nwas very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch\r\ndollar, and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people\r\nof the boat for my passage, who at first refus\'d it, on account of my\r\nrowing; but I insisted on their taking it. A man being sometimes more\r\ngenerous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,\r\nperhaps thro\' fear of being thought to have but little.\r\n\r\nThen I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I\r\nmet a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring\r\nwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker\'s he directed me to,\r\nin Second-street, and ask\'d for bisket, intending such as we had in\r\nBoston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I\r\nasked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not\r\nconsidering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater\r\ncheapness nor the names of his bread, I bade him give me three-penny\r\nworth of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I\r\nwas surpris\'d at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my\r\npockets, walk\'d off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.\r\nThus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the\r\ndoor of Mr. Read, my future wife\'s father; when she, standing at the\r\ndoor, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,\r\nridiculous appearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and\r\npart of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round,\r\nfound myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to\r\nwhich I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with\r\none of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came\r\ndown the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "She, standing at the door, saw me, and thought I made,\r\nas I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous appearance"]\r\n\r\nThus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had\r\nmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I\r\njoined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the\r\nQuakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round\r\nawhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro\' labour and want\r\nof rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continu\'d so till\r\nthe meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was,\r\ntherefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWalking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of\r\npeople, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik\'d, and,\r\naccosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get\r\nlodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. "Here,"\r\nsays he, "is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a\r\nreputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I\'ll show thee a better."\r\nHe brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got a\r\ndinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked\r\nme, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I\r\nmight be some runaway.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, my sleepiness return\'d, and being shown to a bed, I lay\r\ndown without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call\'d\r\nto supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till next\r\nmorning. Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to Andrew\r\nBradford the printer\'s. I found in the shop the old man his father,\r\nwhom I had seen at New York, and who, traveling on horseback, had got\r\nto Philadelphia before me. He introduc\'d me to his son, who receiv\'d\r\nme civilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present\r\nwant a hand, being lately suppli\'d with one; but there was another\r\nprinter in town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ\r\nme; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he would\r\ngive me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; and\r\nwhen we found him, "Neighbour," says Bradford, "I have brought to see\r\nyou a young man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one." He\r\nask\'d me a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see how\r\nI work\'d, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had just\r\nthen nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never\r\nseen before, to be one of the town\'s people that had a good will for\r\nhim, enter\'d into a conversation on his present undertaking and\r\nprospects; while Bradford, not discovering that he was the other\r\nprinter\'s father, on Keimer\'s saying he expected soon to get the\r\ngreatest part of the business into his own hands, drew him on by\r\nartful questions, and starting little doubts, to explain all his\r\nviews, what interest he reli\'d on, and in what manner he intended to\r\nproceed. I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one of\r\nthem was a crafty old sophister, and the other a mere novice. Bradford\r\nleft me with Keimer, who was greatly surpris\'d when I told him who the\r\nold man was.\r\n\r\nKeimer\'s printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter\'d press,\r\nand one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then using\r\nhimself, composing an Elegy on Aquilla Rose, before mentioned, an\r\ningenious young man, of excellent character, much respected in the\r\ntown, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet. Keimer made verses\r\ntoo, but very indifferently. He could not be said to write them, for\r\nhis manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.\r\nSo there being no copy,[27] but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likely\r\nto require all the letter, no one could help him. I endeavour\'d to put\r\nhis press (which he had not yet us\'d, and of which he understood\r\nnothing) into order fit to be work\'d with; and, promising to come and\r\nprint off his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready, I\r\nreturn\'d to Bradford\'s, who gave me a little job to do for the\r\npresent, and there I lodged and dieted. A few days after, Keimer sent\r\nfor me to print off the Elegy. And now he had got another pair of\r\ncases,[28] and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work.\r\n\r\nThese two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.\r\nBradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer,\r\ntho\' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of\r\npresswork. He had been one of the French prophets,[29] and could act\r\ntheir enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any\r\nparticular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very\r\nignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of\r\nthe knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford\'s\r\nwhile I work\'d with him. He had a house, indeed, but without\r\nfurniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr.\r\nRead\'s before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest\r\nand clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable\r\nappearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first\r\nhappen\'d to see me eating my roll in the street.\r\n\r\n    [27] Manuscript.\r\n\r\n    [28] The frames for holding type are in two sections, the\r\n    upper for capitals and the lower for small letters.\r\n\r\n    [29] Protestants of the South of France, who became\r\n    fanatical under the persecutions of Louis XIV, and\r\n    thought they had the gift of prophecy. They had as\r\n    mottoes "No Taxes" and "Liberty of Conscience."\r\n\r\nI began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the\r\ntown, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very\r\npleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I lived\r\nvery agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiring\r\nthat any there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins,\r\nwho was in my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him. At length, an\r\nincident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had\r\nintended. I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop\r\nthat traded between Boston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, forty\r\nmiles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter\r\nmentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure,\r\nassuring me of their good will to me, and that everything would be\r\naccommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted me\r\nvery earnestly. I wrote an answer to his letter, thank\'d him for his\r\nadvice, but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a\r\nlight as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFIRST VISIT TO BOSTON\r\n\r\n\r\nSir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle,\r\nand Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter\r\ncame to hand, spoke to him of me, and show\'d him the letter. The\r\ngovernor read it, and seem\'d surpris\'d when he was told my age. He\r\nsaid I appear\'d a young man of promising parts, and therefore should\r\nbe encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and,\r\nif I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his\r\npart, he would procure me the public business, and do me every other\r\nservice in his power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in\r\nBoston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I\r\nbeing at work together near the window, we saw the governor and\r\nanother gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle),\r\nfinely dress\'d, come directly across the street to our house, and\r\nheard them at the door.\r\n\r\nKeimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the\r\ngovernor inquir\'d for me, came up, and with a condescension and\r\npoliteness I had been quite unus\'d to, made me many compliments,\r\ndesired to be acquainted with me, blam\'d me kindly for not having made\r\nmyself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me\r\naway with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to\r\ntaste, as he said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a little\r\nsurprised, and Keimer star\'d like a pig poison\'d.[30] I went, however,\r\nwith the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of\r\nThird-street, and over the Madeira he propos\'d my setting up my\r\nbusiness, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and\r\nColonel French assur\'d me I should have their interest and influence\r\nin procuring the public business of both governments.[31] On my\r\ndoubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he\r\nwould give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages,\r\nand he did not doubt of prevailing with him. So it was concluded I\r\nshould return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor\'s\r\nletter recommending me to my father. In the meantime the intention was\r\nto be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the\r\ngovernor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great\r\nhonour I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable,\r\nfamiliar, and friendly manner imaginable.\r\n\r\n    [30] Temple Franklin considered this specific figure\r\n    vulgar and changed it to "stared with astonishment."\r\n\r\n    [31] Pennsylvania and Delaware.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer\'d for Boston. I\r\ntook leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me\r\nan ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and\r\nstrongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as\r\na thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going down\r\nthe bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were\r\noblig\'d to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. We\r\narriv\'d safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been\r\nabsent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my\r\nbr. Holmes was not yet return\'d, and had not written about me. My\r\nunexpected appearance surpris\'d the family; all were, however, very\r\nglad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to see\r\nhim at his printing-house. I was better dress\'d than ever while in his\r\nservice, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my\r\npockets lin\'d with near five pounds sterling in silver. He receiv\'d me\r\nnot very frankly, look\'d me all over, and turn\'d to his work again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The journeymen were inquisitive]\r\n\r\nThe journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a\r\ncountry it was, and how I lik\'d it. I prais\'d it much, and the happy\r\nlife I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it;\r\nand, one of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc\'d a\r\nhandful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of\r\nraree-show[32] they had not been us\'d to, paper being the money of\r\nBoston.[33] Then I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch;\r\nand, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave them a piece\r\nof eight[34] to drink, and took my leave. This visit of mine offended\r\nhim extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoke to him of a\r\nreconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on good terms together,\r\nand that we might live for the future as brothers, he said I had\r\ninsulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never\r\nforget or forgive it. In this, however, he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n    [32] A peep-show in a box.\r\n\r\n    [33] There were no mints in the colonies, so the metal\r\n    money was of foreign coinage and not nearly so common as\r\n    paper money, which was printed in large quantities in\r\n    America, even in small denominations.\r\n\r\n    [34] Spanish dollar about equivalent to our dollar.\r\n\r\nMy father received the governor\'s letter with some apparent surprise,\r\nbut said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returning\r\nhe show\'d it to him, asked him if he knew Keith, and what kind of man\r\nhe was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to\r\nthink of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of\r\nbeing at man\'s estate. Holmes said what he could in favour of the\r\nproject, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it, and at\r\nlast, gave a flat denial to it. Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir\r\nWilliam, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me,\r\nbut declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his\r\nopinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so\r\nimportant, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.\r\n\r\nMy friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,\r\npleas\'d with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to\r\ngo thither also; and, while I waited for my father\'s determination, he\r\nset out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which\r\nwere a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to\r\ncome with mine and me to New York, where he propos\'d to wait for me.\r\n\r\nMy father, tho\' he did not approve Sir William\'s proposition, was yet\r\npleas\'d that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a character\r\nfrom a person of such note where I had resided, and that I had been so\r\nindustrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a\r\ntime; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my\r\nbrother and me, he gave his consent to my returning again to\r\nPhiladelphia, advis\'d me to behave respectfully to the people there,\r\nendeavour to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooning and\r\nlibeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination; telling me,\r\nthat by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by\r\nthe time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that, if I came near\r\nthe matter, he would help me out with the rest. This was all I could\r\nobtain, except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother\'s love,\r\nwhen I embark\'d again for New York, now with their approbation and\r\ntheir blessing.\r\n\r\nThe sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother\r\nJohn, who had been married and settled there some years. He received\r\nme very affectionately, for he always lov\'d me. A friend of his, one\r\nVernon, having some money due to him in Pennsylvania, about\r\nthirty-five pounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and\r\nkeep it till I had his directions what to remit it in. Accordingly, he\r\ngave me an order. This afterwards occasion\'d me a good deal of\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nAt Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, among\r\nwhich were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible,\r\nmatronlike Quaker woman, with her attendants. I had shown an obliging\r\nreadiness to do her some little services, which impress\'d her I\r\nsuppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw\r\na daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which\r\nthey appear\'d to encourage, she took me aside, and said, "Young man, I\r\nam concern\'d for thee, as thou hast no friend with thee, and seems not\r\nto know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos\'d to;\r\ndepend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their\r\nactions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee into\r\nsome danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a\r\nfriendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them."\r\nAs I seem\'d at first not to think so ill of them as she did, she\r\nmentioned some things she had observ\'d and heard that had escap\'d my\r\nnotice, but now convinc\'d me she was right. I thank\'d her for her kind\r\nadvice, and promis\'d to follow it. When we arriv\'d at New York, they\r\ntold me where they liv\'d, and invited me to come and see them; but I\r\navoided it, and it was well I did; for the next day the captain miss\'d\r\na silver spoon and some other things, that had been taken out of his\r\ncabin, and, knowing that these were a couple of strumpets, he got a\r\nwarrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen goods, and had the\r\nthieves punish\'d. So, tho\' we had escap\'d a sunken rock, which we\r\nscrap\'d upon in the passage, I thought this escape of rather more\r\nimportance to me.\r\n\r\nAt New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv\'d there some time\r\nbefore me. We had been intimate from children, and had read the same\r\nbooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading and\r\nstudying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which\r\nhe far outstript me. While I liv\'d in Boston, most of my hours of\r\nleisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu\'d a sober\r\nas well as an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by\r\nseveral of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise\r\nmaking a good figure in life. But, during my absence, he had acquir\'d\r\na habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and\r\nwhat I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since his\r\narrival at New York, and behav\'d very oddly. He had gam\'d, too, and\r\nlost his money, so that I was oblig\'d to discharge his lodgings, and\r\ndefray his expenses to and at Philadelphia, which prov\'d extremely\r\ninconvenient to me.\r\n\r\nThe then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet), hearing\r\nfrom the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a great\r\nmany books, desir\'d he would bring me to see him. I waited upon him\r\naccordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not\r\nsober. The gov\'r. treated me with great civility, show\'d me his\r\nlibrary, which was a very large one, and we had a good deal of\r\nconversation about books and authors. This was the second governor who\r\nhad done me the honour to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like\r\nme, was very pleasing.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon\'s money,\r\nwithout which we could hardly have finish\'d our journey. Collins\r\nwished to be employ\'d in some counting-house; but, whether they\r\ndiscover\'d his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho\' he\r\nhad some recommendations, he met with no success in any application,\r\nand continu\'d lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at\r\nmy expense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon\'s, he was continually\r\nborrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in\r\nbusiness. At length he had got so much of it that I was distress\'d to\r\nthink what I should do in case of being call\'d on to remit it.\r\n\r\nHis drinking continu\'d, about which we sometimes quarrel\'d; for, when\r\na little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on the\r\nDelaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn. "I\r\nwill be row\'d home," says he. "We will not row you," says I. "You\r\nmust, or stay all night on the water," says he, "just as you please."\r\nThe others said, "Let us row; what signifies it?" But, my mind being\r\nsoured with his other conduct, I continu\'d to refuse. So he swore he\r\nwould make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping\r\non the thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped\r\nmy hand under his crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into\r\nthe river. I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little\r\nconcern about him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the\r\nboat, we had with a few strokes pull\'d her out of his reach; and ever\r\nwhen he drew near the boat, we ask\'d if he would row, striking a few\r\nstrokes to slide her away from him. He was ready to die with\r\nvexation, and obstinately would not promise to row. However, seeing\r\nhim at last beginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home\r\ndripping wet in the evening. We hardly exchang\'d a civil word\r\nafterwards, and a West India captain, who had a commission to procure\r\na tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbados, happening to meet\r\nwith him, agreed to carry him thither. He left me then, promising to\r\nremit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the\r\ndebt; but I never heard of him after.\r\n\r\nThe breaking into this money of Vernon\'s was one of the first great\r\nerrata of my life; and this affair show\'d that my father was not much\r\nout in his judgment when he suppos\'d me too young to manage business\r\nof importance. But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was too\r\nprudent. There was great difference in persons; and discretion did not\r\nalways accompany years, nor was youth always without it. "And since he\r\nwill not set you up," says he, "I will do it myself. Give me an\r\ninventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I will\r\nsend for them. You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv\'d to\r\nhave a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed." This was\r\nspoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the least\r\ndoubt of his meaning what he said. I had hitherto kept the proposition\r\nof my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it. Had\r\nit been known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend,\r\nthat knew him better, would have advis\'d me not to rely on him, as I\r\nafterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises\r\nwhich he never meant to keep. Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how\r\ncould I think his generous offers insincere? I believ\'d him one of the\r\nbest men in the world.\r\n\r\nI presented him an inventory of a little print\'-house, amounting by my\r\ncomputation to about one hundred pounds sterling. He lik\'d it, but\r\nask\'d me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and\r\nsee that everything was good of the kind, might not be of some\r\nadvantage. "Then," says he, "when there, you may make acquaintances,\r\nand establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way."\r\nI agreed that this might be advantageous. "Then," says he, "get\r\nyourself ready to go with Annis;" which was the annual ship, and the\r\nonly one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia.\r\nBut it would be some months before Annis sail\'d, so I continued\r\nworking with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from me,\r\nand in daily apprehensions of being call\'d upon by Vernon, which,\r\nhowever, did not happen for some years after.\r\n\r\nI believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from\r\nBoston, being becalm\'d off Block Island, our people set about catching\r\ncod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution\r\nof not eating animal food, and on this occasion I consider\'d, with my\r\nmaster Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder,\r\nsince none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might\r\njustify the slaughter. All this seemed very reasonable. But I had\r\nformerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of\r\nthe frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc\'d some time between\r\nprinciple and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were\r\nopened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought\r\nI, "If you eat one another, I don\'t see why we mayn\'t eat you." So I\r\ndin\'d upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,\r\nreturning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So\r\nconvenient a thing is it to be a _reasonable creature_, since it\r\nenables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nEARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n\r\nKeimer and I liv\'d on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreed\r\ntolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up. He retained\r\na great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov\'d argumentation. We\r\ntherefore had many disputations. I used to work him so with my\r\nSocratic method, and had trepann\'d him so often by questions\r\napparently so distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by\r\ndegrees led to the point, and brought him into difficulties and\r\ncontradictions, that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would\r\nhardly answer me the most common question, without asking first,\r\n"_What do you intend to infer from that_?" However, it gave him so\r\nhigh an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way, that he\r\nseriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of\r\nsetting up a new sect. He was to preach the doctrines, and I was to\r\nconfound all opponents. When he came to explain with me upon the\r\ndoctrines, I found several conundrums which I objected to, unless I\r\nmight have my way a little too, and introduce some of mine.\r\n\r\nKeimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaic\r\nlaw it is said, "_Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard_." He\r\nlikewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points were\r\nessentials with him. I dislik\'d both; but agreed to admit them upon\r\ncondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food. "I\r\ndoubt," said he, "my constitution will not bear that." I assur\'d him\r\nit would, and that he would be the better for it. He was usually a\r\ngreat glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving\r\nhim. He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company. I did\r\nso, and we held it for three months. We had our victuals dress\'d, and\r\nbrought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had from\r\nme a list of forty dishes, to be prepar\'d for us at different times,\r\nin all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the whim\r\nsuited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, not\r\ncosting us above eighteenpence sterling each per week. I have since\r\nkept several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that,\r\nand that for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so\r\nthat I think there is little in the advice of making those changes by\r\neasy gradations. I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered\r\ngrievously, tired of the project, long\'d for the flesh-pots of Egypt,\r\nand order\'d a roast pig. He invited me and two women friends to dine\r\nwith him; but, it being brought too soon upon table, he could not\r\nresist the temptation, and ate the whole before we came.\r\n\r\nI had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I had a great\r\nrespect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had\r\nthe same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we\r\nwere both very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought\r\nmost prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as\r\na marriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my\r\nreturn, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business.\r\nPerhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I\r\nimagined them to be.\r\n\r\nMy chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph\r\nWatson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two first were\r\nclerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles\r\nBrockden; the other was clerk to a merchant. Watson was a pious,\r\nsensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in\r\ntheir principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as\r\nCollins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.\r\nOsborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his\r\nfriends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticizing. Ralph was\r\ningenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I\r\nnever knew a prettier talker. Both of them were great admirers of\r\npoetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces. Many pleasant\r\nwalks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, near\r\nSchuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr\'d on what we\r\nread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Many pleasant walks we four had together"]\r\n\r\nRalph was inclin\'d to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he\r\nmight become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that\r\nthe best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many\r\nfaults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur\'d him he had no genius\r\nfor poetry, and advis\'d him to think of nothing beyond the business he\r\nwas bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho\' he had no stock, he\r\nmight, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to\r\nemployment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his\r\nown account. I approv\'d the amusing one\'s self with poetry now and\r\nthen, so far as to improve one\'s language, but no farther.\r\n\r\nOn this it was propos\'d that we should each of us, at our next\r\nmeeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by\r\nour mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections. As language and\r\nexpression were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of\r\ninvention by agreeing that the task should be a version of the\r\neighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When the\r\ntime of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me\r\nknow his piece was ready. I told him I had been busy, and, having\r\nlittle inclination, had done nothing. He then show\'d me his piece for\r\nmy opinion, and I much approv\'d it, as it appear\'d to me to have great\r\nmerit. "Now," says he, "Osborne never will allow the least merit in\r\nanything of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy. He is\r\nnot so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,\r\nand produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and so\r\nproduce nothing. We shall then see what he will say to it." It was\r\nagreed, and I immediately transcrib\'d it, that it might appear in my\r\nown hand.\r\n\r\nWe met; Watson\'s performance was read; there were some beauties in it,\r\nbut many defects. Osborne\'s was read; it was much better; Ralph did it\r\njustice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties. He himself\r\nhad nothing to produce. I was backward; seemed desirous of being\r\nexcused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse\r\ncould be admitted; produce I must. It was read and repeated; Watson\r\nand Osborne gave up the contest, and join\'d in applauding it. Ralph\r\nonly made some criticisms, and propos\'d some amendments; but I\r\ndefended my text. Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no\r\nbetter a critic than poet, so he dropt the argument. As they two went\r\nhome together, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor\r\nof what he thought my production; having restrain\'d himself before, as\r\nhe said, lest I should think it flattery. "But who would have\r\nimagin\'d," said he, "that Franklin had been capable of such a\r\nperformance; such painting, such force, such fire! He has even\r\nimprov\'d the original. In his common conversation he seems to have no\r\nchoice of words; he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he\r\nwrites!" When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid\r\nhim, and Osborne was a little laughed at.\r\n\r\nThis transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet. I\r\ndid all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling\r\nverses till _Pope_ cured him.[35] He became, however, a pretty good\r\nprose writer. More of him hereafter. But, as I may not have occasion\r\nagain to mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson\r\ndied in my arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best of\r\nour set. Osborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminent\r\nlawyer and made money, but died young. He and I had made a serious\r\nagreement, that the one who happen\'d first to die should, if possible,\r\nmake a friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found\r\nthings in that separate state. But he never fulfill\'d his promise.\r\n\r\n    [35] "In one of the later editions of the _Dunciad_ occur\r\n    the following lines:\r\n\r\n       \'Silence, ye wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls,\r\n       And makes night hideous--answer him, ye owls.\'\r\n\r\n    To this the poet adds the following note:\r\n\r\n    \'James Ralph, a name inserted after the first editions,\r\n    not known till he writ a swearing-piece called _Sawney_,\r\n    very abusive of Dr. Swift, Mr. Gay, and myself.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFIRST VISIT TO LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his\r\nhouse, and his setting me up was always mention\'d as a fixed thing. I\r\nwas to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,\r\nbesides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money\r\nfor purchasing the press and types, paper, etc. For these letters I\r\nwas appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready;\r\nbut a future time was still named. Thus he went on till the ship,\r\nwhose departure too had been several times postponed, was on the point\r\nof sailing. Then, when I call\'d to take my leave and receive the\r\nletters, his secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governor\r\nwas extremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle, before\r\nthe ship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.\r\n\r\nRalph, though married, and having one child, had determined to\r\naccompany me in this voyage. It was thought he intended to establish a\r\ncorrespondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found\r\nafterwards, that, thro\' some discontent with his wife\'s relations, he\r\npurposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again. Having\r\ntaken leave of my friends, and interchang\'d some promises with Miss\r\nRead, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor\'d at Newcastle.\r\nThe governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary\r\ncame to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he\r\ncould not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost\r\nimportance, but should send the letters to me on board, wished me\r\nheartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc. I returned on board a\r\nlittle puzzled, but still not doubting.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken\r\npassage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a\r\nQuaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work\r\nin Maryland, had engaged the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were\r\nforced to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board\r\nknowing us, were considered as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton and\r\nhis son (it was James, since governor) return\'d from Newcastle to\r\nPhiladelphia, the father being recall\'d by a great fee to plead for a\r\nseized ship; and, just before we sail\'d, Colonel French coming on\r\nboard, and showing me great respect, I was more taken notice of, and,\r\nwith my friend Ralph, invited by the other gentlemen to come into the\r\ncabin, there being now room. Accordingly, we remov\'d thither.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor\'s\r\ndespatches, I ask\'d the captain for those letters that were to be\r\nunder my care. He said all were put into the bag together and he could\r\nnot then come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have\r\nan opportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for the\r\npresent, and we proceeded on our voyage. We had a sociable company in\r\nthe cabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr.\r\nHamilton\'s stores, who had laid in plentifully. In this passage Mr.\r\nDenham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.\r\nThe voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of\r\nbad weather.\r\n\r\nWhen we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and\r\ngave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor\'s\r\nletters. I found none upon which my name was put as under my care. I\r\npicked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be\r\nthe promised letters, especially as one of them was directed to\r\nBasket, the king\'s printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv\'d\r\nin London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who\r\ncame first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith. "I\r\ndon\'t know such a person," says he; but, opening the letter, "O! this\r\nis from Riddlesden. I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal,\r\nand I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from\r\nhim." So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn\'d on his heel and\r\nleft me to serve some customer. I was surprized to find these were not\r\nthe governor\'s letters; and, after recollecting and comparing\r\ncircumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend\r\nDenham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into Keith\'s\r\ncharacter; told me there was not the least probability that he had\r\nwritten any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the\r\nsmallest dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the\r\ngovernor\'s giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit\r\nto give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he\r\nadvised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of my\r\nbusiness. "Among the printers here," said he, "you will improve\r\nyourself, and when you return to America, you will set up to greater\r\nadvantage."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "So, putting the letter into my hand"]\r\n\r\nWe both of us happen\'d to know, as well as the stationer, that\r\nRiddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruin\'d Miss\r\nRead\'s father by persuading him to be bound for him. By this letter it\r\nappear\'d there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of\r\nHamilton (suppos\'d to be then coming over with us); and that Keith was\r\nconcerned in it with Riddlesden. Denham, who was a friend of\r\nHamilton\'s, thought he ought to be acquainted with it; so, when he\r\narriv\'d in England, which was soon after, partly from resentment and\r\nill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, I\r\nwaited on him, and gave him the letter. He thank\'d me cordially, the\r\ninformation being of importance to him; and from that time he became\r\nmy friend, greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we think of a governor\'s playing such pitiful tricks,\r\nand imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was a habit he had\r\nacquired. He wish\'d to please everybody; and, having little to give,\r\nhe gave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, a\r\npretty good writer, and a good governor for the people, tho\' not for\r\nhis constituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimes\r\ndisregarded. Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed\r\nduring his administration.\r\n\r\nRalph and I were inseparable companions. We took lodgings together in\r\nLittle Britain[36] at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as\r\nwe could then afford. He found some relations, but they were poor, and\r\nunable to assist him. He now let me know his intentions of remaining\r\nin London, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia. He had\r\nbrought no money with him, the whole he could muster having been\r\nexpended in paying his passage. I had fifteen pistoles;[37] so he\r\nborrowed occasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out for\r\nbusiness. He first endeavoured to get into the play-house, believing\r\nhimself qualify\'d for an actor; but Wilkes,[38] to whom he apply\'d,\r\nadvis\'d him candidly not to think of that employment, as it was\r\nimpossible he should succeed in it. Then he propos\'d to Roberts, a\r\npublisher in Paternoster Row,[39] to write for him a weekly paper like\r\nthe Spectator, on certain conditions, which Roberts did not approve.\r\nThen he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer, to copy for\r\nthe stationers and lawyers about the Temple,[40] but could find no\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\n    [36] One of the oldest parts of London, north of St.\r\n    Paul\'s Cathedral, called "Little Britain" because the\r\n    Dukes of Brittany used to live there. See the essay\r\n    entitled "Little Britain" in Washington Irving\'s _Sketch\r\n    Book_.\r\n\r\n    [37] A gold coin worth about four dollars in our money.\r\n\r\n    [38] A popular comedian, manager of Drury Lane Theater.\r\n\r\n    [39] Street north of St. Paul\'s, occupied by publishing\r\n    houses.\r\n\r\n    [40] Law schools and lawyers\' residences situated\r\n    southwest of St. Paul\'s, between Fleet Street and the\r\n    Thames.\r\n\r\nI immediately got into work at Palmer\'s, then a famous printing-house\r\nin Bartholomew Close, and here I continu\'d near a year. I was pretty\r\ndiligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to\r\nplays and other places of amusement. We had together consumed all my\r\npistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth. He seem\'d quite\r\nto forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with\r\nMiss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to\r\nlet her know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of the\r\ngreat errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were to\r\nlive it over again. In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept\r\nunable to pay my passage.\r\n\r\nAt Palmer\'s I was employed in composing for the second edition of\r\nWollaston\'s "Religion of Nature." Some of his reasonings not appearing\r\nto me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I\r\nmade remarks on them. It was entitled "A Dissertation on Liberty and\r\nNecessity, Pleasure and Pain." I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I\r\nprinted a small number. It occasion\'d my being more consider\'d by Mr.\r\nPalmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho\' he seriously\r\nexpostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him\r\nappear\'d abominable. My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.\r\n\r\nWhile I lodg\'d in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with one\r\nWilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He had an\r\nimmense collection of second-hand books. Circulating libraries were\r\nnot then in use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms,\r\nwhich I have now forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his\r\nbooks. This I esteem\'d a great advantage, and I made as much use of it\r\nas I could.\r\n\r\nMy pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a\r\nsurgeon, author of a book entitled "The Infallibility of Human\r\nJudgment," it occasioned an acquaintance between us. He took great\r\nnotice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects,\r\ncarried me to the Horns, a pale alehouse in----Lane, Cheapside,\r\nand introduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the "Fable of the\r\nBees," who had a club there, of which he was the soul, being a most\r\nfacetious, entertaining companion. Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr.\r\nPemberton, at Batson\'s Coffee-house, who promis\'d to give me an\r\nopportunity, sometime or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I\r\nwas extreamly desirous; but this never happened.\r\n\r\nI had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was a\r\npurse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. Sir Hans Sloane\r\nheard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his house in Bloomsbury\r\nSquare, where he show\'d me all his curiosities, and persuaded me to\r\nlet him add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely.\r\n\r\nIn our house there lodg\'d a young woman, a milliner, who, I think, had\r\na shop in the Cloisters. She had been genteelly bred, was sensible and\r\nlively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph read plays to her in\r\nthe evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he\r\nfollowed her. They liv\'d together some time; but, he being still out\r\nof business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her\r\nchild, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country\r\nschool, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he\r\nwrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts.\r\nThis, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future\r\nbetter fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he\r\nonce was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the\r\nhonour to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him,\r\nacquainting me that he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, I\r\nthink it was, where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen\r\nboys, at sixpence each per week), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care,\r\nand desiring me to write to him, directing for Mr. Franklin,\r\nschoolmaster, at such a place.\r\n\r\nHe continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of an\r\nepic poem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks and\r\ncorrections. These I gave him from time to time, but endeavour\'d\r\nrather to discourage his proceeding. One of Young\'s Satires[41] was\r\nthen just published. I copy\'d and sent him a great part of it, which\r\nset in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of\r\nadvancement by them. All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued to\r\ncome by every post. In the meantime, Mrs. T----, having on his account\r\nlost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and us\'d to\r\nsend for me and borrow what I could spare to help her out of them. I\r\ngrew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious\r\nrestraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted\r\nfamiliarities (another erratum) which she repuls\'d with a proper\r\nresentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour. This made a breach\r\nbetween us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he\r\nthought I had cancell\'d all the obligations he had been under to me.\r\nSo I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him or\r\nadvanc\'d for him. This, however, was not then of much consequence, as\r\nhe was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found\r\nmyself relieved from a burthen. I now began to think of getting a\r\nlittle money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer\'s\r\nto work at Watts\'s, near Lincoln\'s Inn Fields, a still greater\r\nprinting-house.[42] Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.\r\n\r\n    [41] Edward Young (1681-1765), an English poet. See his\r\n    satires, Vol. III, Epist. ii, page 70.\r\n\r\n    [42] The printing press at which Franklin worked is\r\n    preserved in the Patent Office at Washington.\r\n\r\nAt my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at\r\npress, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us\'d\r\nto in America, where presswork is mix\'d with composing. I drank only\r\nwater; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of\r\nbeer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types\r\nin each hand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wondered\r\nto see, from this and several instances, that the _Water-American_, as\r\nthey called me, was _stronger_ than themselves, who drank _strong_\r\nbeer! We had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to\r\nsupply the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day a pint\r\nbefore breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a\r\npint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the\r\nafternoon about six o\'clock, and another when he had done his day\'s\r\nwork. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he\r\nsuppos\'d, to drink _strong_ beer, that he might be _strong_ to labour.\r\nI endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by\r\nbeer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley\r\ndissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour\r\nin a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a\r\npint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.\r\nHe drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his\r\nwages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I was\r\nfree from. And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I took to working at press"]\r\n\r\nWatts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room,[43]\r\nI left the pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five\r\nshillings, was demanded of me by the compositors. I thought it an\r\nimposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbade\r\nmy paying it. I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered\r\nas an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief\r\ndone me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,\r\netc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed\r\nto the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly\r\nadmitted, that, notwithstanding the master\'s protection, I found myself\r\noblig\'d to comply and pay the money, convinc\'d of the folly of being on\r\nill terms with those one is to live with continually.\r\n\r\n    [43] Franklin now left the work of operating the printing\r\n    presses, which was largely a matter of manual labor, and\r\n    began setting type, which required more skill and\r\n    intelligence.\r\n\r\nI was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir\'d considerable\r\ninfluence. I propos\'d some reasonable alterations in their chappel\r\nlaws,[44] and carried them against all opposition. From my example, a\r\ngreat part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread,\r\nand cheese, finding they could with me be supply\'d from a neighbouring\r\nhouse with a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled with\r\npepper, crumb\'d with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the price\r\nof a pint of beer, viz., three half-pence. This was a more comfortable\r\nas well as cheaper breakfast, and keep their heads clearer. Those who\r\ncontinued sotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of\r\ncredit at the alehouse, and us\'d to make interest with me to get beer;\r\ntheir _light_, as they phrased it, _being out_. I watch\'d the\r\npay-table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engag\'d for\r\nthem, having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their\r\naccounts. This, and my being esteem\'d a pretty good _riggite_, that\r\nis, a jocular verbal satirist, supported my consequence in the\r\nsociety. My constant attendance (I never making a St. Monday)[45]\r\nrecommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness at composing\r\noccasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch, which was generally\r\nbetter paid. So I went on now very agreeably.\r\n\r\n    [44] A printing house is called a chapel because Caxton,\r\n    the first English printer, did his printing in a chapel\r\n    connected with Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n    [45] A holiday taken to prolong the dissipation of\r\n    Saturday\'s wages.\r\n\r\nMy lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another in\r\nDuke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair of stairs\r\nbackwards, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept the house; she\r\nhad a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended the\r\nwarehouse, but lodg\'d abroad. After sending to inquire my character at\r\nthe house where I last lodg\'d she agreed to take me in at the same\r\nrate, 3s. 6d. per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she\r\nexpected in having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, an\r\nelderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman\'s\r\ndaughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband,\r\nwhose memory she much revered; had lived much among people of\r\ndistinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the\r\ntimes of Charles the Second. She was lame in her knees with the gout,\r\nand, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so sometimes wanted\r\ncompany; and hers was so highly amusing to me, that I was sure to\r\nspend an evening with her whenever she desired it. Our supper was\r\nonly half an anchovy each, on a very little strip of bread and butter,\r\nand half a pint of ale between us; but the entertainment was in her\r\nconversation. My always keeping good hours, and giving little trouble\r\nin the family, made her unwilling to part with me, so that, when I\r\ntalk\'d of a lodging I had heard of, nearer my business, for two\r\nshillings a week, which, intent as I now was on saving money, made\r\nsome difference, she bid me not think of it, for she would abate me\r\ntwo shillings a week for the future; so I remained with her at one\r\nshilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London.\r\n\r\nIn a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in the\r\nmost retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: that\r\nshe was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg\'d\r\nin a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country not\r\nagreeing with her, she returned to England, where, there being no\r\nnunnery, she had vow\'d to lead the life of a nun, as near as might be\r\ndone in those circumstances. Accordingly, she had given all her estate\r\nto charitable uses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on,\r\nand out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity, living\r\nherself on water-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it. She had\r\nlived many years in that garret, being permitted to remain there\r\ngratis by successive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they\r\ndeemed it a blessing to have her there. A priest visited her to\r\nconfess her every day. "I have ask\'d her," says my landlady, "how she,\r\nas she liv\'d, could possibly find so much employment for a confessor?"\r\n"Oh," said she, "it is impossible to avoid _vain thoughts_." I was\r\npermitted once to visit her. She was cheerful and polite, and\r\nconvers\'d pleasantly. The room was clean, but had no other furniture\r\nthan a matras, a table with a crucifix and book, a stool which she\r\ngave me to sit on, and a picture over the chimney of Saint Veronica\r\ndisplaying her handkerchief, with the miraculous figure of Christ\'s\r\nbleeding face on it,[46] which she explained to me with great\r\nseriousness. She look\'d pale, but was never sick; and I give it as\r\nanother instance on how small an income, life and health may be\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nAt Watts\'s printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an\r\ningenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had\r\nbeen better educated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist,\r\nspoke French, and lov\'d reading. I taught him and a friend of his to\r\nswim at twice going into the river, and they soon became good\r\nswimmers. They introduc\'d me to some gentlemen from the country, who\r\nwent to Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero\'s\r\ncuriosities.[47] In our return, at the request of the company, whose\r\ncuriosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river,\r\nand swam from near Chelsea to Blackfriar\'s,[48] performing on the way\r\nmany feats of activity, both upon and under water, that surpris\'d and\r\npleas\'d those to whom they were novelties.\r\n\r\n    [46] The story is that she met Christ on His way to\r\n    crucifixion and offered Him her handkerchief to wipe the\r\n    blood from His face, after which the handkerchief always\r\n    bore the image of Christ\'s bleeding face.\r\n\r\n    [47] James Salter, a former servant of Hans Sloane, lived\r\n    in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. "His house, a barber-shop, was\r\n    known as \'Don Saltero\'s Coffee-House.\' The curiosities\r\n    were in glass cases and constituted an amazing and\r\n    motley collection--a petrified crab from China, a\r\n    \'lignified hog,\' Job\'s tears, Madagascar lances, William\r\n    the Conqueror\'s flaming sword, and Henry the Eighth\'s\r\n    coat of mail."--Smyth.\r\n\r\n    [48] About three miles.\r\n\r\nI had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studied\r\nand practis\'d all Thevenot\'s motions and positions, added some of my\r\nown, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful. All these\r\nI took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much\r\nflatter\'d by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of\r\nbecoming a master, grew more and more attach\'d to me on that account,\r\nas well as from the similarity of our studies. He at length proposed\r\nto me traveling all over Europe together, supporting ourselves\r\neverywhere by working at our business. I was once inclined to it; but,\r\nmentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an\r\nhour when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think\r\nonly of returning to Pennsylvania, which he was now about to do.\r\n\r\nI must record one trait of this good man\'s character. He had formerly\r\nbeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,\r\ncompounded and went to America. There, by a close application to\r\nbusiness as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few\r\nyears. Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old\r\ncreditors to an entertainment, at which he thank\'d them for the easy\r\ncomposition they had favoured him with, and, when they expected\r\nnothing but the treat, every man at the first remove found under his\r\nplate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid\r\nremainder with interest.\r\n\r\nHe now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should\r\ncarry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.\r\nHe propos\'d to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which\r\nhe would instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store. He\r\nadded, that, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile\r\nbusiness, he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and\r\nbread, etc., to the West Indies, and procure me commissions from\r\nothers which would be profitable; and, if I manag\'d well, would\r\nestablish me handsomely. The thing pleas\'d me; for I was grown tired\r\nof London, remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent in\r\nPennsylvania, and wish\'d again to see it; therefore I immediately\r\nagreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year,[49] Pennsylvania money;\r\nless, indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affording\r\na better prospect.\r\n\r\n    [49] About $167.\r\n\r\nI now took leave of printing, as I thought, forever, and was daily\r\nemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the\r\ntradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack\'d up,\r\ndoing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all\r\nwas on board, I had a few days\' leisure. On one of these days, I was,\r\nto my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or\r\nother of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars, and of my teaching\r\nWygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons,\r\nabout to set out on their travels; he wish\'d to have them first taught\r\nswimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them.\r\nThey were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could\r\nnot undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that,\r\nif I were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get\r\na good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the\r\noverture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have\r\nreturned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more\r\nimportance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham,\r\nbecome Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.\r\n\r\nThus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I\r\nwork\'d hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in\r\nseeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed\r\nme about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive;\r\na great sum out of my small earnings! I lov\'d him, notwithstanding,\r\nfor he had many amiable qualities. I had by no means improv\'d my\r\nfortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose\r\nconversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBEGINNING BUSINESS IN\r\nPHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe sail\'d from Gravesend on the 23rd of July, 1726. For the incidents\r\nof the voyage, I refer you to my Journal, where you will find them all\r\nminutely related. Perhaps the most important part of that journal is\r\nthe _plan_[50] to be found in it, which I formed at sea, for\r\nregulating my future conduct in life. It is the more remarkable, as\r\nbeing formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully\r\nadhered to quite thro\' to old age.\r\n\r\n    [50] "Not found in the manuscript journal, which was left\r\n    among Franklin\'s papers."--Bigelow.\r\n\r\nWe landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry\r\nalterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major\r\nGordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem\'d a\r\nlittle asham\'d at seeing me, but pass\'d without saying anything. I\r\nshould have been as much asham\'d at seeing Miss Read, had not her\r\nfriends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my\r\nletter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which\r\nwas done in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and\r\nsoon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name,\r\nit being now said that he had another wife. He was a worthless fellow,\r\ntho\' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. He\r\ngot into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and\r\ndied there. Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply\'d with\r\nstationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho\' none good,\r\nand seem\'d to have a great deal of business.\r\n\r\nMr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open\'d our goods; I\r\nattended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a\r\nlittle time, expert at selling. We lodg\'d and boarded together; he\r\ncounsell\'d me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected\r\nand loved him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in\r\nthe beginning of February, 1726/7, when I had just pass\'d my\r\ntwenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a\r\npleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal,\r\ngave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I\r\nfound myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now,\r\nsome time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again.\r\nI forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at\r\nlength carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative\r\nwill, as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to\r\nthe wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his\r\nexecutors, and my employment under him ended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street"]\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my\r\nreturn to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large\r\nwages by the year, to come and take the management of his\r\nprinting-house, that he might better attend his stationer\'s shop. I\r\nhad heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her\r\nfriends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. I tri\'d\r\nfor farther employment as a merchant\'s clerk; but, not readily meeting\r\nwith any, I clos\'d again with Keimer. I found in his house these\r\nhands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bred\r\nto country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid\r\nobservation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. Stephen\r\nPotts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon\r\nnatural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he\r\nhad agreed with at extream low wages per week to be rais\'d a shilling\r\nevery three months, as they would deserve by improving in their\r\nbusiness; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on\r\nhereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at\r\npress, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach\r\nthem, though he knew neither one nor t\'other. John----, a wild\r\nIrishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four\r\nyears, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was\r\nto be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for\r\nfour years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of\r\nwhom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken\r\napprentice.\r\n\r\nI soon perceiv\'d that the intention of engaging me at wages so much\r\nhigher than he had been us\'d to give, was, to have these raw, cheap\r\nhands form\'d thro\' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then\r\nthey being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I\r\nwent on, however, very chearfully, put his printing-house in order,\r\nwhich had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to\r\nmind their business and to do it better.\r\n\r\nIt was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a\r\nbought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave\r\nme this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated\r\nat a grammar-school there, had been distinguish\'d among the scholars\r\nfor some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they\r\nexhibited plays; belong\'d to the Witty Club there, and had written\r\nsome pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester\r\nnewspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a\r\nyear, but not well satisfi\'d, wishing of all things to see London, and\r\nbecome a player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of\r\nfifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk\'d out of\r\ntown, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where,\r\nhaving no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent\r\nhis guineas, found no means of being introduc\'d among the players,\r\ngrew necessitous, pawn\'d his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking the\r\nstreet very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp\'s\r\nbill[51] was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and\r\nencouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. He\r\nwent directly, sign\'d the indentures, was put into the ship, and came\r\nover, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of\r\nhim. He was lively, witty, good-natur\'d, and a pleasant companion, but\r\nidle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.\r\n\r\n    [51] A crimp was the agent of a shipping company. Crimps\r\n    were sometimes employed to decoy men into such service\r\n    as is here mentioned.\r\n\r\nJohn, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very\r\nagreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer\r\nincapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something\r\ndaily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer\'s Sabbath, so I\r\nhad two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the\r\ntown increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and\r\napparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,\r\nwhich I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor \xc3\xa6conomist.\r\nHe, however, kindly made no demand of it.\r\n\r\nOur printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder\r\nin America; I had seen types cast at James\'s in London, but without\r\nmuch attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made\r\nuse of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the mattrices in lead,\r\nand thus supply\'d in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies. I also\r\nengrav\'d several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was\r\nwarehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a fac-totum.\r\n\r\nBut, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became\r\nevery day of less importance, as the other hands improv\'d in the\r\nbusiness; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter\'s wages, he let me\r\nknow that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an\r\nabatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master,\r\nfrequently found fault, was captious, and seem\'d ready for an\r\noutbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,\r\nthinking that his encumber\'d circumstances were partly the cause. At\r\nlength a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening\r\nnear the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was\r\nthe matter. Keimer, being in the street, look\'d up and saw me, call\'d\r\nout to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding\r\nsome reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity,\r\nall the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being\r\nwitnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into the\r\nprinting-house, continu\'d the quarrel, high words pass\'d on both\r\nsides, he gave me the quarter\'s warning we had stipulated, expressing\r\na wish that he had not been oblig\'d to so long a warning. I told him\r\nhis wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so,\r\ntaking my hat, walk\'d out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw\r\nbelow, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to my\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nMeredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair\r\nover. He had conceiv\'d a great regard for me, and was very unwilling\r\nthat I should leave the house while he remain\'d in it. He dissuaded me\r\nfrom returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he\r\nreminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess\'d; that his\r\ncreditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold\r\noften without profit for ready money, and often trusted without\r\nkeeping accounts; that he must therefore fail, which would make a\r\nvacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me\r\nknow that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some\r\ndiscourse that had pass\'d between them, he was sure would advance\r\nmoney to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. "My\r\ntime," says he, "will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time\r\nwe may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am no\r\nworkman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be set\r\nagainst the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally."\r\n\r\nThe proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town\r\nand approv\'d of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his\r\nson, had prevailed on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he\r\nhop\'d might break him of that wretched habit entirely, when we came to\r\nbe so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who\r\ncarry\'d it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to\r\nbe kept till they should arrive, and in the meantime I was to get\r\nwork, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy\r\nthere, and so remained idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of\r\nbeing employ\'d to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would\r\nrequire cuts and various types that I only could supply, and\r\napprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent\r\nme a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few\r\nwords, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.\r\nMeredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for\r\nhis improvement under my daily instructions; so I return\'d, and we\r\nwent on more smoothly than for some time before. The New Jersey jobb\r\nwas obtained, I contriv\'d a copperplate press for it, the first that\r\nhad been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks for\r\nthe bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole\r\nto satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be\r\nenabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water.\r\n\r\nAt Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the\r\nprovince. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a\r\ncommittee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were\r\nprinted than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns,\r\nconstantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a\r\nfriend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv\'d by\r\nreading than Keimer\'s, I suppose it was for that reason my\r\nconversation seem\'d to be more valu\'d. They had me to their houses,\r\nintroduced me to their friends, and show\'d me much civility; while he,\r\ntho\' the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish;\r\nignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv\'d opinions,\r\nslovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of\r\nreligion, and a little knavish withal.\r\n\r\nWe continu\'d there near three months; and by that time I could reckon\r\namong my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary\r\nof the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the\r\nSmiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general.\r\nThe latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began\r\nfor himself, when young, by wheeling clay for brick-makers, learned to\r\nwrite after he was of age, carri\'d the chain for surveyors, who taught\r\nhim surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir\'d a good\r\nestate; and says he, "I foresee that you will soon work this man out\r\nof his business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia." He had not\r\nthen the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.\r\nThese friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally\r\nwas to some of them. They all continued their regard for me as long as\r\nthey lived.\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well\r\nto let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles\r\nand morals, that you may see how far those influenc\'d the future\r\nevents of my life. My parents had early given me religious\r\nimpressions, and brought me through my childhood piously in the\r\nDissenting way. But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by\r\nturns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different\r\nbooks I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books\r\nagainst Deism[52] fell into my hands; they were said to be the\r\nsubstance of sermons preached at Boyle\'s Lectures. It happened that\r\nthey wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by\r\nthem; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be\r\nrefuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short,\r\nI soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others,\r\nparticularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards\r\nwrong\'d me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting\r\nKeith\'s conduct towards me (who was another free-thinker), and my own\r\ntowards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I\r\nbegan to suspect that this doctrine, tho\' it might be true, was not\r\nvery useful. My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these lines\r\nof Dryden:[53]\r\n\r\n  "Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man\r\n   Sees but a part o\' the chain, the nearest link:\r\n   His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,\r\n   That poises all above;"\r\n\r\nand from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and\r\npower, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world,\r\nand that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things\r\nexisting, appear\'d now not so clever a performance as I once thought\r\nit; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself\r\nunperceiv\'d into my argument, so as to infect all that follow\'d, as is\r\ncommon in metaphysical reasonings.\r\n\r\n    [52] The creed of an eighteenth century theological sect\r\n    which, while believing in God, refused to credit the\r\n    possibility of miracles and to acknowledge the validity\r\n    of revelation.\r\n\r\n    [53] A great English poet, dramatist, and critic\r\n    (1631-1700). The lines are inaccurately quoted from\r\n    Dryden\'s OEdipus, Act III, Scene I, line 293.\r\n\r\nI grew convinc\'d that _truth_, _sincerity_ and _integrity_ in dealings\r\nbetween man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of\r\nlife; and I form\'d written resolutions, which still remain in my\r\njournal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation had\r\nindeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain\'d an opinion that,\r\nthough certain actions might not be bad _because_ they were forbidden\r\nby it, or good _because_ it commanded them, yet probably these actions\r\nmight be forbidden _because_ they were bad for us, or commanded\r\n_because_ they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the\r\ncircumstances of things considered. And this persuasion, with the kind\r\nhand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favourable\r\ncircumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro\'\r\nthis dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was\r\nsometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my\r\nfather, without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might\r\nhave been expected from my want of religion. I say willful, because\r\nthe instances I have mentioned had something of _necessity_ in them,\r\nfrom my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I had\r\ntherefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it\r\nproperly, and determin\'d to preserve it.\r\n\r\nWe had not been long return\'d to Philadelphia before the new types\r\narriv\'d from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by his\r\nconsent before he heard of it. We found a house to hire near the\r\nmarket, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was then but\r\ntwenty-four pounds a year, tho\' I have since known it to let for\r\nseventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who\r\nwere to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with\r\nthem. We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order,\r\nbefore George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to\r\nus, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer. All our\r\ncash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been\r\nobliged to procure, and this countryman\'s five shillings, being our\r\nfirst-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any\r\ncrown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has\r\nmade me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to\r\nassist young beginners.\r\n\r\nThere are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a\r\none then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with\r\na wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel\r\nMickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door,\r\nand asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new\r\nprinting-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was\r\nsorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense\r\nwould be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people\r\nalready half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the\r\ncontrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his\r\ncertain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things\r\nthat would soon ruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes\r\nnow existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me half\r\nmelancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this business,\r\nprobably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in\r\nthis decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for\r\nmany years to buy a house there, because all was going to\r\ndestruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five\r\ntimes as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first\r\nbegan his croaking.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding\r\nyear, I had form\'d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of\r\nmutual improvement, which was called the Junto;[54] we met on Friday\r\nevenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his\r\nturn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals,\r\nPolitics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss\'d by the company; and\r\nonce in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on\r\nany subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of\r\na president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry\r\nafter truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and,\r\nto prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or\r\ndirect contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and\r\nprohibited under small pecuniary penalties.\r\n\r\n    [54] A Spanish term meaning a combination for political\r\n    intrigue; here a club or society.\r\n\r\nThe first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for the\r\nscriveners, a good-natur\'d, friendly middle-ag\'d man, a great lover\r\nof poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was\r\ntolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of\r\nsensible conversation.\r\n\r\nThomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and\r\nafterward inventor of what is now called Hadley\'s Quadrant. But he\r\nknew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like\r\nmost great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal\r\nprecision in everything said, or was forever denying or distinguishing\r\nupon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation. He soon left us.\r\n\r\nNicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov\'d\r\nbooks, and sometimes made a few verses.\r\n\r\nWilliam Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but, loving reading, had acquir\'d a\r\nconsiderable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view\r\nto astrology, that he afterwards laught at it. He also became\r\nsurveyor-general.\r\n\r\nWilliam Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,\r\nsensible man.\r\n\r\nHugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz\'d\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nRobert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and\r\nwitty; a lover of punning and of his friends.\r\n\r\nAnd William Coleman, then a merchant\'s clerk, about my age, who had\r\nthe coolest, clearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of\r\nalmost any man I ever met with. He became afterwards a merchant of\r\ngreat note, and one of our provincial judges. Our friendship continued\r\nwithout interruption to his death, upwards of forty years; and the\r\nclub continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy,\r\nmorality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our\r\nqueries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us\r\nupon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might\r\nspeak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of\r\nconversation, everything being studied in our rules which might\r\nprevent our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance of\r\nthe club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nBut my giving this account of it here is to show something of the\r\ninterest I had, everyone of these exerting themselves in recommending\r\nbusiness to us. Breintnal particularly procur\'d us from the Quakers\r\nthe printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done\r\nby Keimer; and upon this we work\'d exceedingly hard, for the price was\r\nlow. It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer\r\nnotes.[55] I compos\'d of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off\r\nat press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I\r\nhad finished my distribution for the next day\'s work, for the little\r\njobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. But so\r\ndetermin\'d I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that\r\none night, when, having impos\'d[56] my forms, I thought my day\'s work\r\nover, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to\r\npi,[57] I immediately distribut\'d and composed it over again before I\r\nwent to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began to\r\ngive us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mention\r\nbeing made of the new printing-office at the merchants\' Every-night\r\nclub, the general opinion was that it must fail, there being already\r\ntwo printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom\r\nyou and I saw many years after at his native place, St. Andrew\'s in\r\nScotland) gave a contrary opinion: "For the industry of that\r\nFranklin," says he, "is superior to anything I ever saw of the kind; I\r\nsee him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work\r\nagain before his neighbors are out of bed." This struck the rest, and\r\nwe soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with\r\nstationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business.\r\n\r\n    [55] A sheet 8-1/2 by 13-1/2 inches, having the words\r\n    _pro patria_ in translucent letters in the body of the\r\n    paper. Pica--a size of type; as, A B C D: Long Primer--a\r\n    smaller size of type; as, A B C D.\r\n\r\n    [56] To arrange and lock up pages or columns of type in a\r\n    rectangular iron frame, ready for printing.\r\n\r\n    [57] Reduced to complete disorder.\r\n\r\nI mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely,\r\ntho\' it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my\r\nposterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when\r\nthey see its effects in my favour throughout this relation.\r\n\r\nGeorge Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to\r\npurchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a\r\njourneyman to us. We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let\r\nhim know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and\r\nmight then have work for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, were\r\nfounded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford,\r\nwas a paltry thing, wretchedly manag\'d, no way entertaining, and yet\r\nwas profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely\r\nfail of good encouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but he\r\ntold it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,\r\npublished proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was to be\r\nemploy\'d. I resented this; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet\r\nbegin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment for\r\nBradford\'s paper, under the title of the Busy Body, which Breintnal\r\ncontinu\'d some months. By this means the attention of the publick was\r\nfixed on that paper, and Keimer\'s proposals, which we burlesqu\'d and\r\nridicul\'d, were disregarded. He began his paper, however, and, after\r\ncarrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety\r\nsubscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle; and I, having been\r\nready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and it\r\nprov\'d in a few years extremely profitable to me.\r\n\r\nI perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our\r\npartnership still continu\'d; the reason may be that, in fact, the\r\nwhole management of the business lay upon me. Meredith was no\r\ncompositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. My friends lamented my\r\nconnection with him, but I was to make the best of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I see him still at work when I go home from club"]\r\n\r\nOur first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in\r\nthe province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited\r\nremarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor\r\nBurnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,\r\noccasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk\'d of, and\r\nin a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.\r\n\r\nTheir example was follow\'d by many, and our number went on growing\r\ncontinually. This was one of the first good effects of my having\r\nlearnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeing\r\na newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen,\r\nthought it convenient to oblige and encourage me. Bradford still\r\nprinted the votes, and laws, and other publick business. He had\r\nprinted an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,\r\nblundering manner; we reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sent\r\none to every member. They were sensible of the difference: it\r\nstrengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they voted us\r\ntheir printers for the year ensuing.\r\n\r\nAmong my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton, before\r\nmentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it.\r\nHe interested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did in\r\nmany others afterward, continuing his patronage till his death.[58]\r\n\r\n    [58] I got his son once \xc2\xa3500.--_Marg. note_.\r\n\r\nMr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow\'d him,\r\nbut did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of\r\nacknowledgment, crav\'d his forbearance a little longer, which he\r\nallow\'d me, and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with\r\ninterest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nBut now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least\r\nreason to expect. Mr. Meredith\'s father, who was to have paid for our\r\nprinting-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to\r\nadvance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a\r\nhundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su\'d us\r\nall. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais\'d in\r\ntime, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our\r\nhopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters\r\nmust be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.\r\n\r\nIn this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never\r\nforgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came\r\nto me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application\r\nfrom me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should\r\nbe necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if\r\nthat should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the\r\npartnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in\r\nthe streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our\r\ndiscredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I\r\ntold them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain\'d\r\nof the Meredith\'s fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I\r\nthought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done,\r\nand would do if they could; but, if they finally fail\'d in their\r\nperformance, and our partnership must be dissolv\'d, I should then\r\nthink myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.\r\n\r\nThus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,\r\n"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken\r\nin this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me\r\nwhat he would for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I will\r\nresign the whole to you, and go about my business." "No," said he, "my\r\nfather has really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am\r\nunwilling to distress him farther. I see this is a business I am not\r\nfit for. I was bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to\r\ntown, and put myself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a\r\nnew trade. Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in North\r\nCarolina, where land is cheap. I am inclin\'d to go with them, and\r\nfollow my old employment. You may find friends to assist you. If you\r\nwill take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father the\r\nhundred pounds he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give\r\nme thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership,\r\nand leave the whole in your hands." I agreed to this proposal: it was\r\ndrawn up in writing, sign\'d, and seal\'d immediately. I gave him what\r\nhe demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent\r\nme next year two long letters, containing the best account that had\r\nbeen given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc.,\r\nfor in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in the\r\npapers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone, I recurr\'d to my two friends; and because I\r\nwould not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of what\r\neach had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid off\r\nthe company\'s debts, and went on with the business in my own name,\r\nadvertising that the partnership was dissolved. I think this was in or\r\nabout the year 1729.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nBUSINESS SUCCESS AND FIRST\r\nPUBLIC SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,\r\nonly fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that\r\nsoon to be sunk.[59] The wealthy inhabitants oppos\'d any addition,\r\nbeing against all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would\r\ndepreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all\r\ncreditors. We had discuss\'d this point in our Junto, where I was on\r\nthe side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum\r\nstruck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment,\r\nand number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old\r\nhouses inhabited, and many new ones building: whereas I remembered\r\nwell, that when I first walk\'d about the streets of Philadelphia,\r\neating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut Street, between\r\nSecond and Front streets,[60] with bills on their doors, "To be let";\r\nand many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me\r\nthen think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n    [59] Recalled to be redeemed.\r\n\r\n    [60] This part of Philadelphia is now the center of the\r\n    wholesale business district.\r\n\r\nOur debates possess\'d me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and\r\nprinted an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled "_The Nature and\r\nNecessity of a Paper Currency_." It was well receiv\'d by the common\r\npeople in general; but the rich men dislik\'d it, for it increas\'d and\r\nstrengthen\'d the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no\r\nwriters among them that were able to answer it, their opposition\r\nslacken\'d, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. My\r\nfriends there, who conceiv\'d I had been of some service, thought fit\r\nto reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable\r\njobb and a great help to me. This was another advantage gain\'d by my\r\nbeing able to write.\r\n\r\nThe utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident\r\nas never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to\r\nfifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds,\r\nsince which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while\r\nincreasing, tho\' I now think there are limits beyond which the\r\nquantity may be hurtful.[61]\r\n\r\n    [61] Paper money is a promise to pay its face value in\r\n    gold or silver. When a state or nation issues more such\r\n    promises than there is a likelihood of its being able to\r\n    redeem, the paper representing the promises depreciates\r\n    in value. Before the success of the Colonies in the\r\n    Revolution was assured, it took hundreds of dollars of\r\n    their paper money to buy a pair of boots.\r\n\r\nI soon after obtain\'d, thro\' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the\r\nNewcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;\r\nsmall things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and\r\nthese, to me, were really great advantages, as they were great\r\nencouragements. He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and\r\nvotes of that government, which continu\'d in my hands as long as I\r\nfollow\'d the business.\r\n\r\nI now open\'d a little stationer\'s shop. I had in it blanks of all\r\nsorts, the correctest that ever appear\'d among us, being assisted in\r\nthat by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen\'s\r\nbooks, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an\r\nexcellent workman, now came to me, and work\'d with me constantly and\r\ndiligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquilla Rose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas\'d at the\r\nstores thro\' the streets on a wheelbarrow"]\r\n\r\nI began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the\r\nprinting-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a\r\ntradesman, I took care not only to be in _reality_ industrious and\r\nfrugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly;\r\nI was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing\r\nor shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch\'d me from my work, but\r\nthat was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was\r\nnot above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas\'d\r\nat the stores thro\' the streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus being esteem\'d\r\nan industrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought,\r\nthe merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others\r\nproposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In the\r\nmeantime, Keimer\'s credit and business declining daily, he was at last\r\nforc\'d to sell his printing-house to satisfy his creditors. He went to\r\nBarbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.\r\n\r\nHis apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work\'d with\r\nhim, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials.\r\nI was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his\r\nfriends were very able, and had a good deal of interest. I therefore\r\npropos\'d a partnership to him, which he, fortunately for me, rejected\r\nwith scorn. He was very proud, dress\'d like a gentleman, liv\'d\r\nexpensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and\r\nneglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and,\r\nfinding nothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the\r\nprinting-house with him. There this apprentice employ\'d his former\r\nmaster as a journeyman; they quarrell\'d often; Harry went continually\r\nbehindhand, and at length was forc\'d to sell his types and return to\r\nhis country work in Pennsylvania. The person that bought them employ\'d\r\nKeimer to use them, but in a few years he died.\r\n\r\nThere remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old\r\none, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and\r\nthen by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business.\r\nHowever, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had better\r\nopportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better\r\ndistributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many more,\r\nwhich was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for,\r\ntho\' I did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publick\r\nopinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders,\r\nwho took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it,\r\nwhich occasion\'d some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly\r\nof him for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took\r\ncare never to imitate it.\r\n\r\nI had hitherto continu\'d to board with Godfrey, who lived in part of\r\nmy house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop for\r\nhis glazier\'s business, tho\' he worked little, being always absorbed\r\nin his mathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a\r\nrelation\'s daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together,\r\ntill a serious courtship on my part ensu\'d, the girl being in herself\r\nvery deserving. The old folks encourag\'d me by continual invitations\r\nto supper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to\r\nexplain. Mrs. Godfrey manag\'d our little treaty. I let her know that I\r\nexpected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my\r\nremaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then\r\nabove a hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to\r\nspare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The\r\nanswer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve the\r\nmatch; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been informed the\r\nprinting business was not a profitable one; the types would soon be\r\nworn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one\r\nafter the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and,\r\ntherefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up.\r\n\r\nWhether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on a\r\nsupposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and\r\ntherefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at\r\nliberty to give or withhold what they pleas\'d, I know not; but I\r\nsuspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfrey\r\nbrought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their\r\ndisposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declared\r\nabsolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.\r\nThis was resented by the Godfreys; we differed, and they removed,\r\nleaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.\r\n\r\nBut this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look\'d round\r\nme and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found\r\nthat, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I\r\nwas not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I\r\nshould not otherwise think agreeable. A friendly correspondence as\r\nneighbours and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs.\r\nRead\'s family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my first\r\nlodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in\r\ntheir affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti\'d poor Miss\r\nRead\'s unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom\r\nchearful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and\r\ninconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her\r\nunhappiness, tho\' the mother was good enough to think the fault more\r\nher own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went\r\nthither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual\r\naffection was revived, but there were now great objections to our\r\nunion. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife\r\nbeing said to be living in England; but this could not easily be\r\nprov\'d, because of the distance; and, tho\' there was a report of his\r\ndeath, it was not certain. Then, tho\' it should be true, he had left\r\nmany debts, which his successor might be call\'d upon to pay. We\r\nventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her to\r\nwife, September 1st, 1730. None of the inconveniences happened that we\r\nhad apprehended; she proved a good and faithful helpmate,[62] assisted\r\nme much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have ever\r\nmutually endeavour\'d to make each other happy. Thus I corrected that\r\ngreat _erratum_ as well as I could.\r\n\r\n    [62] Mrs. Franklin survived her marriage over forty\r\n    years. Franklin\'s correspondence abounds with evidence\r\n    that their union was a happy one. "We are grown old\r\n    together, and if she has any faults, I am so used to\r\n    them that I don\'t perceive them." The following is a\r\n    stanza from one of Franklin\'s own songs written for the\r\n    Junto:\r\n\r\n      "Of their Chloes and Phyllises poets may prate,\r\n         I sing my plain country Joan,\r\n       These twelve years my wife, still the joy of my life,\r\n         Blest day that I made her my own."\r\n\r\nAbout this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little\r\nroom of Mr. Grace\'s, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was\r\nmade by me, that, since our books were often referr\'d to in our\r\ndisquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have\r\nthem altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be\r\nconsulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we\r\nshould, while we lik\'d to keep them together, have each of us the\r\nadvantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be\r\nnearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole. It was lik\'d and\r\nagreed to, and we fill\'d one end of the room with such books as we\r\ncould best spare. The number was not so great as we expected; and tho\'\r\nthey had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want\r\nof due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was\r\nseparated, and each took his books home again.\r\n\r\nAnd now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a\r\nsubscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into form\r\nby our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in\r\nthe Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin\r\nwith, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company\r\nwas to continue. We afterwards obtain\'d a charter, the company being\r\nincreased to one hundred: this was the mother of all the North\r\nAmerican subscription libraries, now so numerous. It is become a great\r\nthing itself, and continually increasing. These libraries have\r\nimproved the general conversation of the Americans, made the common\r\ntradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other\r\ncountries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so\r\ngenerally made throughout the colonies in defense of their\r\nprivileges.[63]\r\n\r\n_Mem\xc2\xb0._ Thus far was written with the intention express\'d in the\r\nbeginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no\r\nimportance to others. What follows was written many years after in\r\ncompliance with the advice contain\'d in these letters, and accordingly\r\nintended for the public. The affairs of the Revolution occasion\'d the\r\ninterruption.[64]\r\n\r\n    [63] Here the first part of the _Autobiography_, written\r\n    at Twyford in 1771, ends. The second part, which\r\n    follows, was written at Passy in 1784.\r\n\r\n    [64] After this memorandum, Franklin inserted letters\r\n    from Abel James and Benjamin Vaughan, urging him to\r\n    continue his _Autobiography_.\r\n\r\n[_Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,\r\n1784._]\r\n\r\nIt is some time since I receiv\'d the above letters, but I have been\r\ntoo busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain.\r\nIt might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,\r\nwhich would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return\r\nbeing uncertain, and having just now a little leisure, I will\r\nendeavour to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it\r\nmay there be corrected and improv\'d.\r\n\r\nNot having any copy here of what is already written, I know not\r\nwhether an account is given of the means I used to establish the\r\nPhiladelphia public library, which, from a small beginning, is now\r\nbecome so considerable, though I remember to have come down to near\r\nthe time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with\r\nan account of it, which may be struck out if found to have been\r\nalready given.\r\n\r\nAt the time I establish\'d myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good\r\nbookseller\'s shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.\r\nIn New York and Philad\'a the printers were indeed stationers; they\r\nsold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common\r\nschool-books. Those who lov\'d reading were obliged to send for their\r\nbooks from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had\r\nleft the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our\r\nclub in. I propos\'d that we should all of us bring our books to that\r\nroom, where they would not only be ready to consult in our\r\nconferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty\r\nto borrow such as he wish\'d to read at home. This was accordingly\r\ndone, and for some time contented us.\r\n\r\nFinding the advantage of this little collection, I propos\'d to render\r\nthe benefit from books more common, by commencing a public\r\nsubscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would\r\nbe necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to\r\nput the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by\r\nwhich each subscriber engag\'d to pay a certain sum down for the first\r\npurchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So\r\nfew were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of\r\nus so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more\r\nthan fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for\r\nthis purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. On\r\nthis little fund we began. The books were imported; the library was\r\nopened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their\r\npromissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. The\r\ninstitution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns,\r\nand in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations;\r\nreading became fashionable; and our people, having no publick\r\namusements to divert their attention from study, became better\r\nacquainted with books, and in a few years were observ\'d by strangers\r\nto be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same\r\nrank generally are in other countries.\r\n\r\nWhen we were about to sign the above mentioned articles, which were\r\nto be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden,\r\nthe scrivener, said to us, "You are young men, but it is scarcely\r\nprobable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term\r\nfix\'d in the instrument." A number of us, however, are yet living; but\r\nthe instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that\r\nincorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.\r\n\r\nThe objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the\r\nsubscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one\'s\r\nself as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos\'d to\r\nraise one\'s reputation in the smallest degree above that of one\'s\r\nneighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that\r\nproject. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and\r\nstated it as a scheme of a _number of friends_, who had requested me\r\nto go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.\r\nIn this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after\r\npractis\'d it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can\r\nheartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity\r\nwill afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to\r\nwhom the merit belongs, someone more vain than yourself will be\r\nencouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you\r\njustice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to\r\ntheir right owner.\r\n\r\nThis library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,\r\nfor which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair\'d in\r\nsome degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended\r\nfor me. Reading was the only amusement I allow\'d myself. I spent no\r\ntime in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in\r\nmy business continu\'d as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was\r\nindebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be\r\neducated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who\r\nwere established in the place before me. My circumstances, however,\r\ngrew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and my\r\nfather having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently\r\nrepeated a proverb of Solomon, "Seest thou a man diligent in his\r\ncalling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean\r\nmen," I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth\r\nand distinction, which encourag\'d me, tho\' I did not think that I\r\nshould ever literally _stand before kings_, which, however, has since\r\nhappened; for I have stood before _five_, and even had the honor of\r\nsitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.\r\n\r\nWe have an English proverb that says, "_He that would thrive, must ask\r\nhis wife_." It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos\'d to\r\nindustry and frugality as myself. She assisted me chearfully in my\r\nbusiness, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing\r\nold linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc. We kept no idle\r\nservants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the\r\ncheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time break and milk\r\n(no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a\r\npewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a\r\nprogress, in spite of principle: being call\'d one morning to\r\nbreakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They\r\nhad been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost\r\nher the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had\r\nno other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought _her_ husband\r\ndeserv\'d a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his\r\nneighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our\r\nhouse, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas\'d,\r\naugmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.\r\n\r\nI had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and though some of\r\nthe dogmas of that persuasion, such as the _eternal decrees of God_,\r\n_election_, _reprobation_, _etc._, appeared to me unintelligible,\r\nothers doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public\r\nassemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was\r\nwithout some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the\r\nexistence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern\'d it by his\r\nProvidence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good\r\nto man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be\r\npunished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. These I\r\nesteem\'d the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found in\r\nall the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho\'\r\nwith different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix\'d\r\nwith other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote,\r\nor confirm morality, serv\'d principally to divide us, and make us\r\nunfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion that\r\nthe worst had some good effects, induc\'d me to avoid all discourse\r\nthat might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his\r\nown religion; and as our province increas\'d in people, and new places\r\nof worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary\r\ncontribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect,\r\nwas never refused.\r\n\r\nTho\' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of\r\nits propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I\r\nregularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only\r\nPresbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us\'d to\r\nvisit me sometimes as a friend, and admonished me to attend his\r\nadministrations, and I was now and then prevail\'d on to do so, once\r\nfor five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a good\r\npreacher, perhaps I might have continued,[65] notwithstanding the\r\noccasion I had for the Sunday\'s leisure in my course of study; but his\r\ndiscourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of\r\nthe peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry,\r\nuninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle was\r\ninculcated or enforc\'d, their aim seeming to be rather to make us\r\nPresbyterians than good citizens.\r\n\r\n    [65] Franklin expressed a different view about the duty\r\n    of attending church later.\r\n\r\nAt length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of\r\nPhilippians, "_Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest,\r\njust, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any\r\npraise, think on these things._" And I imagin\'d, in a sermon on such a\r\ntext, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin\'d\r\nhimself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping\r\nholy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy\r\nScriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the\r\nSacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God\'s ministers. These might be\r\nall good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that I\r\nexpected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from\r\nany other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had\r\nsome years before compos\'d a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my\r\nown private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, _Articles of Belief and\r\nActs of Religion_. I return\'d to the use of this, and went no more to\r\nthe public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it,\r\nwithout attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to\r\nrelate facts, and not to make apologies for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nPLAN FOR ATTAINING MORAL\r\nPERFECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of\r\narriving at moral perfection. I wish\'d to live without committing any\r\nfault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural\r\ninclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or\r\nthought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might\r\nnot always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had\r\nundertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.[66] While my\r\ncare was employ\'d in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised\r\nby another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was\r\nsometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere\r\nspeculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely\r\nvirtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the\r\ncontrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and\r\nestablished, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform\r\nrectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the\r\nfollowing method.\r\n\r\n    [66] Compare Philippians iv, 8.\r\n\r\nIn the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my\r\nreading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different\r\nwriters included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance,\r\nfor example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by\r\nothers it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure,\r\nappetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our\r\navarice and ambition. I propos\'d to myself, for the sake of clearness,\r\nto use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex\'d to each, than a few\r\nnames with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues\r\nall that at that time occurr\'d to me as necessary or desirable, and\r\nannexed to each a short precept, which fully express\'d the extent I\r\ngave to its meaning.\r\n\r\nThese names of virtues, with their precepts, were:\r\n\r\n1. Temperance.\r\n\r\nEat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\r\n\r\n2. Silence.\r\n\r\nSpeak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n3. Order.\r\n\r\nLet all your things have their places; let each part of your business\r\nhave its time.\r\n\r\n4. Resolution.\r\n\r\nResolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n5. Frugality.\r\n\r\nMake no expense but to do good to others or yourself; _i. e._, waste\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n6. INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nLose no time; be always employ\'d in something useful; cut off all\r\nunnecessary actions.\r\n\r\n7. Sincerity.\r\n\r\nUse no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak,\r\nspeak accordingly.\r\n\r\n8. Justice.\r\n\r\nWrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n9. Moderation.\r\n\r\nAvoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\n10. Cleanliness.\r\n\r\nTolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.\r\n\r\n11. Tranquillity.\r\n\r\nBe not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\r\n\r\n12. Chastity.\r\n\r\n13. Humility.\r\n\r\nImitate Jesus and Socrates.\r\n\r\nMy intention being to acquire the _habitude_ of all these virtues, I\r\njudg\'d it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the\r\nwhole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I\r\nshould be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till\r\nI should have gone thro\' the thirteen; and, as the previous\r\nacquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain\r\nothers, I arrang\'d them with that view, as they stand above.\r\nTemperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness\r\nof head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept\r\nup, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient\r\nhabits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir\'d\r\nand establish\'d, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to\r\ngain knowledge at the same time that I improv\'d in virtue, and\r\nconsidering that in conversation it was obtain\'d rather by the use of\r\nthe ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I\r\nwas getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me\r\nacceptable to trifling company, I gave _Silence_ the second place.\r\nThis and the next, _Order_, I expected would allow me more time for\r\nattending to my project and my studies. _Resolution_, once become\r\nhabitual, would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the\r\nsubsequent virtues; _Frugality_ and Industry freeing me from my\r\nremaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make\r\nmore easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving\r\nthen, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras[67] in his Golden\r\nVerses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the\r\nfollowing method for conducting that examination.\r\n\r\nI made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the\r\nvirtues.[68] I rul\'d each page with red ink, so as to have seven\r\ncolumns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a\r\nletter for the day. I cross\'d these columns with thirteen red lines,\r\nmarking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the\r\nvirtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a\r\nlittle black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been\r\ncommitted respecting that virtue upon that day.\r\n\r\n    [67] A famous Greek philosopher, who lived about 582-500\r\n    B. C. The _Golden Verses_ here ascribed to him are\r\n    probably of later origin. "The time which he recommends\r\n    for this work is about even or bed-time, that we may\r\n    conclude the action of the day with the judgment of\r\n    conscience, making the examination of our conversation\r\n    an evening song to God."\r\n\r\n    [68] This "little book" is dated July 1, 1733.--W.

Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid\r\nevery the least offense against _Temperance_, leaving the other\r\nvirtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the\r\nfaults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first\r\nline, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos\'d the habit of that virtue so\r\nmuch strengthen\'d, and its opposite weaken\'d, that I might venture\r\nextending my attention to include the next, and for the following week\r\nkeep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could\r\ngo thro\' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a\r\nyear. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to\r\neradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and\r\nhis strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having\r\naccomplish\'d the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I\r\nhoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I\r\nmade in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till\r\nin the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a\r\nclean book, after a thirteen weeks\' daily examination.\r\n\r\nThis my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison\'s\r\n_Cato_:\r\n\r\n  "Here will I hold. If there\'s a power above us\r\n   (And that there is, all nature cries aloud\r\n   Thro\' all her works), He must delight in virtue;\r\n   And that which he delights in must be happy."\r\n\r\nAnother from Cicero,\r\n\r\n"O vit\xc3\xa6 Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque\r\nvitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex pr\xc3\xa6ceptis tuis\r\nactus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus."[69]\r\n\r\n    [69] "O philosophy, guide of life! O searcher out of\r\n    virtue and exterminator of vice! One day spent well and\r\n    in accordance with thy precepts is worth an immortality\r\n    of sin."--_Tusculan Inquiries_, Book V.\r\n\r\nAnother from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:\r\n\r\n"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand\r\nriches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\r\nand all her paths are peace." iii. 16, 17.\r\n\r\nAnd conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right\r\nand necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end\r\nI formed the following little prayer, which was prefix\'d to my tables\r\nof examination, for daily use.\r\n\r\n"_O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful\r\nGuide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my\r\ntruest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what\r\nthat wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy other\r\nchildren as the only return in my power for thy continual\r\nfavours to me_."\r\n\r\nI used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson\'s\r\nPoems, viz.:\r\n\r\n  "Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!\r\n   O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!\r\n   Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,\r\n   From every low pursuit; and fill my soul\r\n   With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;\r\n   Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!"\r\n\r\nThe precept of _Order_ requiring that _every part of my business\r\nshould have its allotted time_, one page in my little book contain\'d\r\nthe following scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a\r\nnatural day.\r\n\r\n                            { 5}  Rise, wash, and address\r\n                            { 6}  _Powerful Goodness_!\r\nThe Morning.                {  }  Contrive day\'s\r\n_Question._ What good       {  }  business, and take the\r\nshall I do this day?        {  }  resolution of the day;\r\n                            { 7}  prosecute the present\r\n                            {  }  study, and breakfast.\r\n\r\n                              8}\r\n                              9}  Work.\r\n                             10}\r\n                             11}\r\n\r\nNoon.              {12}  Read, or overlook my\r\n                            { 1}  accounts, and dine.\r\n\r\n                              2}\r\n                              3}  Work.\r\n                              4}\r\n                              5}\r\nEvening.                    { 6} Put things in their\r\n_Question._ What good       { 7} places.

I was\r\nsurpris\'d to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined;\r\nbut I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the\r\ntrouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping\r\nout the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in\r\na new course, became full of holes, I transferr\'d my tables and\r\nprecepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines\r\nwere drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines\r\nI mark\'d my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could\r\neasily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went thro\' one\r\ncourse only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, till\r\nat length I omitted them entirely, being employ\'d in voyages and\r\nbusiness abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I\r\nalways carried my little book with me.\r\n\r\nMy scheme of Order gave me the most trouble;[70] and I found that, tho\'\r\nit might be practicable where a man\'s business was such as to leave\r\nhim the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for\r\ninstance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who\r\nmust mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their\r\nown hours. _Order_, too, with regard to places for things, papers,\r\netc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early\r\naccustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so\r\nsensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article,\r\ntherefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it\r\nvexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had\r\nsuch frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the\r\nattempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect,\r\nlike the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired to\r\nhave the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith\r\nconsented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he\r\nturn\'d, while the smith press\'d the broad face of the ax hard and\r\nheavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The\r\nman came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went\r\non, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther\r\ngrinding. "No," said the smith, "turn on, turn on; we shall have it\r\nbright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled." "Yes," says the man,\r\n"_but I think I like a speckled ax best_." And I believe this may have\r\nbeen the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I\r\nemploy\'d, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad\r\nhabits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle,\r\nand concluded that "_a speckled ax was best_"; for something, that\r\npretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that\r\nsuch extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery\r\nin morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a\r\nperfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being\r\nenvied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults\r\nin himself, to keep his friends in countenance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he\r\nwould turn the wheel"]\r\n\r\n    [70] Professor McMaster tells us that when Franklin was\r\n    American Agent in France, his lack of business order was\r\n    a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends.\r\n    "Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold\r\n    papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most\r\n    careless way over the table and floor."\r\n\r\nIn truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I\r\nam grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it.\r\nBut, on the whole, tho\' I never arrived at the perfection I had been\r\nso ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the\r\nendeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have\r\nbeen if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by\r\nimitating the engraved copies, tho\' they never reach the wish\'d-for\r\nexcellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, and\r\nis tolerable while it continues fair and legible.\r\n\r\nIt may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little\r\nartifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow\'d the constant\r\nfelicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written.\r\nWhat reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence;\r\nbut, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy\'d ought to\r\nhelp his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes\r\nhis long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good\r\nconstitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his\r\ncircumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge\r\nthat enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some\r\ndegree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the\r\nconfidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon\r\nhim; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues,[71]\r\neven in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that\r\nevenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes\r\nhis company still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger\r\nacquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may\r\nfollow the example and reap the benefit.\r\n\r\n    [71] While there can be no question that Franklin\'s moral\r\n    improvement and happiness were due to the practice of\r\n    these virtues, yet most people will agree that we shall\r\n    have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to\r\n    a virtuous life. Franklin\'s own suggestion that the\r\n    scheme smacks of "foppery in morals" seems justified.\r\n    Woodrow Wilson well puts it: "Men do not take fire from\r\n    such thoughts, unless something deeper, which is missing\r\n    here, shine through them. What may have seemed to the\r\n    eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us\r\n    nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of\r\n    good sense and sound conduct. What redeems it from\r\n    pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of\r\n    usefulness to be seen in Franklin himself, who set these\r\n    standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own\r\n    life." See _Galatians_, chapter V, for the Christian\r\n    plan of moral perfection.\r\n\r\nIt will be remark\'d that, tho\' my scheme was not wholly without\r\nreligion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets\r\nof any particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully\r\npersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it\r\nmight be serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some\r\ntime or other to publish it, I would not have anything in it that\r\nshould prejudice anyone, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a\r\nlittle comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the\r\nadvantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite\r\nvice; and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue,[72] because\r\nit would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which\r\nwould have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that\r\ndoes not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle\'s\r\nman of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and\r\nhungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them\r\nto be fed and clothed.--James ii. 15, 16.\r\n\r\n    [72] Nothing so likely to make a man\'s fortune as\r\n    virtue.--_Marg. note_.\r\n\r\nBut it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this\r\ncomment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put\r\ndown short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use\r\nof in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close\r\nattention to private business in the earlier part of my life, and\r\npublic business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being\r\nconnected in my mind with _a great and extensive project_, that\r\nrequired the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession\r\nof employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain\'d\r\nunfinish\'d.\r\n\r\nIn this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,\r\nthat vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but\r\nforbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone\r\nconsidered; that it was, therefore, everyone\'s interest to be virtuous\r\nwho wish\'d to be happy even in this world; and I should, from this\r\ncircumstance (there being always in the world a number of rich\r\nmerchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest\r\ninstruments for the management of their affairs, and such being so\r\nrare), have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities\r\nwere so likely to make a poor man\'s fortune as those of probity and\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nMy list of virtues contain\'d at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend\r\nhaving kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my\r\npride show\'d itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content\r\nwith being in the right when discussing any point, but was\r\noverbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc\'d me by\r\nmentioning several instances; I determined endeavouring to cure\r\nmyself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest, and I added\r\n_Humility_ to my list, giving an extensive meaning to the word.\r\n\r\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the _reality_ of this\r\nvirtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the _appearance_ of it. I\r\nmade it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments\r\nof others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself,\r\nagreeably to the old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or\r\nexpression in the language that imported a fix\'d opinion, such as\r\n_certainly, undoubtedly_, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, _I\r\nconceive, I apprehend_, or _I imagine_ a thing to be so or so; or it\r\n_so appears to me at present_. When another asserted something that I\r\nthought an error, I deny\'d myself the pleasure of contradicting him\r\nabruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his\r\nproposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain\r\ncases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present\r\ncase there _appear\'d_ or _seem\'d_ to me some difference, etc. I soon\r\nfound the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I\r\nengag\'d in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos\'d\r\nmy opinions procur\'d them a readier reception and less contradiction;\r\nI had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I\r\nmore easily prevail\'d with others to give up their mistakes and join\r\nwith me when I happened to be in the right.\r\n\r\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural\r\ninclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that\r\nperhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical\r\nexpression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of\r\nintegrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much\r\nweight with my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or\r\nalterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when\r\nI became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent,\r\nsubject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in\r\nlanguage, and yet I generally carried my points.\r\n\r\nIn reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard\r\nto subdue as _pride_. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down,\r\nstifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and\r\nwill every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it,\r\nperhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that I\r\nhad compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\r\n\r\n[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]\r\n\r\n[_"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but cannot have the\r\nhelp expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war. I\r\nhave, however, found the following."_][73]\r\n\r\n    [73] This is a marginal memorandum.--B.\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned _a great and extensive project_ which I had\r\nconceiv\'d, it seems proper that some account should be here given of\r\nthat project and its object. Its first rise in my mind appears in the\r\nfollowing little paper, accidentally preserv\'d, viz.:\r\n\r\n_Observations_ on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.\r\n\r\n"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are\r\ncarried on and effected by parties.\r\n\r\n"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or\r\nwhat they take to be such.\r\n\r\n"That the different views of these different parties occasion all\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his\r\nparticular private interest in view.\r\n\r\n"That as soon as a party has gain\'d its general point, each member\r\nbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,\r\nbreaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.\r\n\r\n"That few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their\r\ncountry, whatever they may pretend; and, tho\' their actings bring real\r\ngood to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and\r\ntheir country\'s interest was united, and did not act from a principle\r\nof benevolence.\r\n\r\n"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a\r\nUnited Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all\r\nnations into a regular body, to be govern\'d by suitable good and wise\r\nrules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their\r\nobedience to, than common people are to common laws.\r\n\r\n"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well\r\nqualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\r\n\r\nB. F."\r\n\r\nRevolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when\r\nmy circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down\r\nfrom time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr\'d to me\r\nrespecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be\r\nthe substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the\r\nessentials of every known religion, and being free of everything that\r\nmight shock the professors of any religion. It is express\'d in these\r\nwords, viz.:\r\n\r\n"That there is one God, who made all things.\r\n\r\n"That he governs the world by his providence.\r\n\r\n"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and\r\nthanksgiving.\r\n\r\n"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\r\n\r\n"That the soul is immortal.\r\n\r\n"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either\r\nhere or hereafter."\r\n\r\nMy ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread\r\nat first among young and single men only; that each person to be\r\ninitiated should not only declare his assent to such creed, but should\r\nhave exercised himself with the thirteen weeks\' examination and\r\npractice of the virtues, as in the beforemention\'d model; that the\r\nexistence of such a society should be kept a secret, till it was\r\nbecome considerable, to prevent solicitations for the admission of\r\nimproper persons, but that the members should each of them search\r\namong his acquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom,\r\nwith prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually communicated;\r\nthat the members should engage to afford their advice, assistance, and\r\nsupport to each other in promoting one another\'s interests, business,\r\nand advancement in life; that, for distinction, we should be call\'d\r\n_The Society of the Free and Easy_: free, as being, by the general\r\npractice and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of vice;\r\nand particularly by the practice of industry and frugality, free from\r\ndebt, which exposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to\r\nhis creditors.\r\n\r\nThis is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I\r\ncommunicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some\r\nenthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was\r\nunder of sticking close to my business, occasioned my postponing the\r\nfurther prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious\r\noccupations, public and private, induc\'d me to continue postponing, so\r\nthat it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity\r\nleft sufficient for such an enterprise; though I am still of opinion\r\nthat it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, by\r\nforming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag\'d by\r\nthe seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought\r\nthat one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and\r\naccomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan,\r\nand, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert\r\nhis attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study\r\nand business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nPOOR RICHARD\'S ALMANAC AND\r\nOTHER ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1732 I first publish\'d my Almanack, under the name of _Richard\r\nSaunders_; it was continu\'d by me about twenty-five years, commonly\r\ncall\'d _Poor Richard\'s Almanac_.[74] I endeavour\'d to make it both\r\nentertaining and useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand,\r\nthat I reap\'d considerable profit from it, vending annually near ten\r\nthousand. And observing that it was generally read, scarce any\r\nneighborhood in the province being without it, I consider\'d it as a\r\nproper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, who\r\nbought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the little\r\nspaces that occurr\'d between the remarkable days in the calendar with\r\nproverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry and\r\nfrugality, as the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing\r\nvirtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to act always\r\nhonestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs, _it is hard for an\r\nempty sack to stand upright_.\r\n\r\n    [74] The almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as\r\n    well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather.\r\n    Franklin took his title from _Poor Robin_, a famous\r\n    English almanac, and from Richard Saunders, a well-known\r\n    almanac publisher. For the maxims of Poor Richard, see\r\n    pages 331-335.\r\n\r\nThese proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I\r\nassembled and form\'d into a connected discourse prefix\'d to the Almanack\r\nof 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an\r\nauction. The bringing all these scatter\'d councils thus into a focus\r\nenabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally\r\napproved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted\r\nin Britain on a broadside, to be stuck up in houses; two translations\r\nwere made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and\r\ngentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign\r\nsuperfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing\r\nthat growing plenty of money which was observable for several years\r\nafter its publication.\r\n\r\nTwo pages from _Poor Richard\'s Almanac_ for 1736.

Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that,\r\nwhatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not\r\nproperly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial,\r\nshowing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a\r\nhabitude, and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations.\r\nThese may be found in the papers about the beginning of 1735.[75]\r\n\r\n    [75] June 23 and July 7, 1730.--Smyth.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libeling and\r\npersonal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our\r\ncountry. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and\r\nthe writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press,\r\nand that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which anyone who would\r\npay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the\r\npiece separately if desired, and the author might have as many copies\r\nas he pleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me\r\nto spread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my\r\nsubscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or\r\nentertaining, I could not fill their papers with private altercation,\r\nin which they had no concern, without doing them manifest injustice.\r\nNow, many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of\r\nindividuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among\r\nourselves, augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels; and\r\nare, moreover, so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the\r\ngovernment of neighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best\r\nnational allies, which may be attended with the most pernicious\r\nconsequences. These things I mention as a caution to young printers,\r\nand that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and\r\ndisgrace their profession by such infamous practices, but refuse\r\nsteadily, as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct\r\nwill not, on the whole, be injurious to their interests.\r\n\r\nIn 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina,\r\nwhere a printer was wanting. I furnish\'d him with a press and letters,\r\non an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of\r\nthe profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was a\r\nman of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and,\r\ntho\' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from\r\nhim, nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. On\r\nhis decease, the business was continued by his widow, who, being born\r\nand bred in Holland, where, as I have been inform\'d, the knowledge of\r\naccounts makes a part of female education, she not only sent me as\r\nclear a state as she could find of the transactions past, but\r\ncontinued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every\r\nquarter afterwards, and managed the business with such success, that\r\nshe not only brought up reputably a family of children, but, at the\r\nexpiration of the term, was able to purchase of me the printing-house,\r\nand establish her son in it.\r\n\r\nI mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch\r\nof education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to\r\nthem and their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or\r\ndancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men,\r\nand enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house,\r\nwith establish\'d correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to\r\nundertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young\r\nPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good\r\nvoice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew\r\ntogether considerable numbers of different persuasions, who join\'d in\r\nadmiring them. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers,\r\nhis sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind,\r\nbut inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in the\r\nreligious stile are called good works. Those, however, of our\r\ncongregation, who considered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians,\r\ndisapprov\'d his doctrine, and were join\'d by most of the old clergy,\r\nwho arraign\'d him of heterodoxy before the synod, in order to have him\r\nsilenc\'d. I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could\r\nto raise a party in his favour, and we combated for him awhile with\r\nsome hopes of success. There was much scribbling pro and con upon the\r\noccasion; and finding that, tho\' an elegant preacher, he was but a\r\npoor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three\r\npamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April, 1735. Those\r\npamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial writings, tho\'\r\neagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I question\r\nwhether a single copy of them now exists.[76]\r\n\r\n    [76] See "A List of Books written by, or relating to\r\n    Benjamin Franklin," by Paul Leicester Ford. 1889. p.\r\n    15.--Smyth.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.\r\nOne of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much\r\nadmired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least\r\na part of it. On search, he found that part quoted at length, in one\r\nof the British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster\'s.[77] This\r\ndetection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned\r\nhis cause, and occasion\'d our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I\r\nstuck by him, however, as I rather approv\'d his giving us good sermons\r\ncomposed by others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho\' the\r\nlatter was the practice of our common teachers. He afterward\r\nacknowledg\'d to me that none of those he preach\'d were his own;\r\nadding, that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat\r\nany sermon after one reading only. On our defeat, he left us in search\r\nelsewhere of better fortune, and I quitted the congregation, never\r\njoining it after, tho\' I continu\'d many years my subscription for the\r\nsupport of its ministers.\r\n\r\n    [77] Dr. James Foster (1697-1753):--\r\n\r\n        "Let modest Foster, if he will excel\r\n         Ten metropolitans in preaching well."\r\n\r\n              --Pope (Epilogue to the Satires, I, 132).\r\n\r\n    "Those who had not heard Farinelli sing and Foster\r\n    preach were not qualified to appear in genteel company,"\r\n    Hawkins. "History of Music."--Smyth.\r\n\r\nI had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a\r\nmaster of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I then\r\nundertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us\'d\r\noften to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too\r\nmuch of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus\'d to play\r\nany more, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game\r\nshould have a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar\r\nto be got by heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the\r\nvanquish\'d was to perform upon honour, before our next meeting. As we\r\nplay\'d pretty equally, we thus beat one another into that language. I\r\nafterwards with a little painstaking, acquir\'d as much of the Spanish\r\nas to read their books also.\r\n\r\nI have already mention\'d that I had only one year\'s instruction in a\r\nLatin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that\r\nlanguage entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the\r\nFrench, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpris\'d to find, on looking over\r\na Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language\r\nthan I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the\r\nstudy of it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages\r\nhad greatly smooth\'d my way.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances, I have thought that there is some\r\ninconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told\r\nthat it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir\'d\r\nthat, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are\r\nderiv\'d from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more\r\neasily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and\r\nget to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more\r\neasily gain them in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the\r\nlowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I would\r\ntherefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the\r\neducation of our youth, whether, since many of those who begin with\r\nthe Latin quit the same after spending some years without having made\r\nany great proficiency, and what they have learnt becomes almost\r\nuseless, so that their time has been lost, it would not have been\r\nbetter to have begun with the French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.;\r\nfor, tho\', after spending the same time, they should quit the study of\r\nlanguages and never arrive at the Latin, they would, however, have\r\nacquired another tongue or two, that, being in modern use, might be\r\nserviceable to them in common life.[78]\r\n\r\n    [78] "The authority of Franklin, the most eminently\r\n    practical man of his age, in favor of reserving the\r\n    study of the dead languages until the mind has reached a\r\n    certain maturity, is confirmed by the confession of one\r\n    of the most eminent scholars of any age.\r\n\r\n    "\'Our seminaries of learning,\' says Gibbon, \'do not\r\n    exactly correspond with the precept of a Spartan king,\r\n    that the child should be instructed in the arts which\r\n    will be useful to the man; since a finished scholar may\r\n    emerge from the head of Westminster or Eton, in total\r\n    ignorance of the business and conversation of English\r\n    gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century.\r\n    But these schools may assume the merit of teaching all\r\n    that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek\r\n    languages.\'"--Bigelow.\r\n\r\nAfter ten years\' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my\r\ncircumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I\r\ncould not sooner well afford. In returning, I call\'d at Newport to see\r\nmy brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former\r\ndifferences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and\r\naffectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me\r\nthat, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I\r\nwould take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up\r\nto the printing business. This I accordingly perform\'d, sending him a\r\nfew years to school before I took him into the office. His mother\r\ncarried on the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with\r\nan assortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn\r\nout. Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I\r\nhad depriv\'d him of by leaving him so early.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Our former differences were forgotten, and our\r\nmeeting was very cordial and affectionate"]\r\n\r\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the\r\nsmall-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and\r\nstill regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I\r\nmention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the\r\nsupposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died\r\nunder it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either\r\nway, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.\r\n\r\nOur club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such\r\nsatisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducing\r\ntheir friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what we\r\nhad settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the\r\nbeginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was\r\npretty well observ\'d; the intention was to avoid applications of\r\nimproper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find\r\nit difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any\r\naddition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a\r\nproposal, that every member separately should endeavour to form a\r\nsubordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and\r\nwithout informing them of the connection with the Junto. The\r\nadvantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more young\r\ncitizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintance with\r\nthe general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as the\r\nJunto member might propose what queries we should desire, and was to\r\nreport to the Junto what pass\'d in his separate club; the promotion of\r\nour particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation,\r\nand the increase of our influence in public affairs, and our power of\r\ndoing good by spreading thro\' the several clubs the sentiments of the\r\nJunto.\r\n\r\nThe project was approv\'d, and every member undertook to form his club,\r\nbut they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, which\r\nwere called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc.\r\nThey were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of\r\namusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some\r\nconsiderable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on\r\nparticular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course\r\nof time as they happened.\r\n\r\nMy first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General\r\nAssembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but the\r\nyear following, when I was again propos\'d (the choice, like that of\r\nthe members, being annual), a new member made a long speech against\r\nme, in order to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen,\r\nwhich was the more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the\r\nimmediate service as clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of\r\nkeeping up an interest among the members, which secur\'d to me the\r\nbusiness of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and other\r\noccasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole, were very\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nI therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a\r\ngentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to\r\ngive him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,\r\nafterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by\r\npaying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this\r\nother method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very\r\nscarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire\r\nof perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of\r\nlending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I\r\nreturn\'d it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my\r\nsense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me\r\n(which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever\r\nafter manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we\r\nbecame great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This\r\nis another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which\r\nsays, _"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do\r\nyou another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."_ And it shows\r\nhow much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent,\r\nreturn, and continue inimical proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then\r\npostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy\r\nat Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and\r\ninexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offered\r\nit to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for,\r\ntho\' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that\r\nimprov\'d my newspaper, increas\'d the number demanded, as well as the\r\nadvertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a\r\nconsiderable income. My old competitor\'s newspaper declin\'d\r\nproportionately, and I was satisfy\'d without retaliating his refusal,\r\nwhile postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders.\r\nThus he suffer\'d greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and I\r\nmention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ\'d in\r\nmanaging affairs for others, that they should always render accounts,\r\nand make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality. The\r\ncharacter of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all\r\nrecommendations to new employments and increase of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nINTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nI began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning,\r\nhowever, with small matters. The city watch was one of the first\r\nthings that I conceiv\'d to want regulation. It was managed by the\r\nconstables of the respective wards in turn; the constable warned a\r\nnumber of housekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chose\r\nnever to attend, paid him six shillings a year to be excus\'d, which\r\nwas suppos\'d to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much\r\nmore than was necessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a\r\nplace of profit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such\r\nragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did\r\nnot choose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected,\r\nand most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to\r\nbe read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting\r\nmore particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the\r\nconstables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a\r\npoor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch\r\ndid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the\r\nwealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds\' worth of goods in\r\nhis stores.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of\r\nproper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more\r\nequitable way of supporting the charge, the levying a tax that should\r\nbe proportion\'d to the property. This idea, being approv\'d by the\r\nJunto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each of\r\nthem; and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution,\r\nyet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way\r\nfor the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs\r\nwere grown into more influence.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was\r\nafterward publish\'d) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by\r\nwhich houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means\r\nproposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece,\r\nand gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a\r\ncompany for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual\r\nassistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger.\r\nAssociates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty.\r\nOur articles of agreement oblig\'d every member to keep always in good\r\norder, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, with\r\nstrong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which\r\nwere to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month\r\nand spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicating\r\nsuch ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires, as might be\r\nuseful in our conduct on such occasions.\r\n\r\nThe utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring\r\nto be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were\r\nadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,\r\none new company being formed after another, till they became so\r\nnumerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of\r\nproperty; and now, at the time of my writing this, tho\' upward of\r\nfifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed, called\r\nthe Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho\' the first\r\nmembers are all deceas\'d but myself and one, who is older by a year\r\nthan I am. The small fines that have been paid by members for absence\r\nat the monthly meetings have been apply\'d to the purchase of\r\nfire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements for\r\neach company, so that I question whether there is a city in the world\r\nbetter provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning\r\nconflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has\r\nnever lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time, and the\r\nflames have often been extinguished before the house in which they\r\nbegan has been half consumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "the flames have often been extinguished"]\r\n\r\nIn 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,[79]\r\nwho had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was\r\nat first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy,\r\ntaking a dislike to him, soon refus\'d him their pulpits, and he was\r\noblig\'d to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and\r\ndenominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was\r\nmatter of speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the\r\nextraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much\r\nthey admir\'d and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of\r\nthem, by assuring them they were naturally _half beasts and half\r\ndevils_. It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners\r\nof our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about\r\nreligion, it seem\'d as if all the world were growing religious, so\r\nthat one could not walk thro\' the town in an evening without hearing\r\npsalms sung in different families of every street.\r\n\r\n    [79] George Whitefield, pronounced Hwit\'field\r\n    (1714-1770), a celebrated English clergyman and pulpit\r\n    orator, one of the founders of Methodism.\r\n\r\nAnd it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject\r\nto its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner\r\npropos\'d, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but\r\nsufficient sums were soon receiv\'d to procure the ground and erect the\r\nbuilding, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the\r\nsize of Westminster Hall;[80] and the work was carried on with such\r\nspirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been\r\nexpected. Both house and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for\r\nthe use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire\r\nto say something to the people at Philadelphia; the design in building\r\nnot being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in\r\ngeneral; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a\r\nmissionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at\r\nhis service.\r\n\r\n    [80] A part of the palace of Westminster, now forming the\r\n    vestibule to the Houses of Parliament in London.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro\' the\r\ncolonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been\r\nbegun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen,\r\naccustomed to labour, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it\r\nwas with families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors,\r\nmany of indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being\r\nset down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to\r\nendure the hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving\r\nmany helpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserable\r\nsituation inspir\'d the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the\r\nidea of building an Orphan House there, in which they might be\r\nsupported and educated. Returning northward, he preach\'d up this\r\ncharity, and made large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful\r\npower over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was\r\nan instance.\r\n\r\nI did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute\r\nof materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from\r\nPhiladelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better\r\nto have built the house here, and brought the children to it. This I\r\nadvis\'d; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my\r\ncounsel, and I therefore refus\'d to contribute. I happened soon after\r\nto attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he\r\nintended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved he\r\nshould get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper\r\nmoney, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he\r\nproceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers.\r\nAnother stroke of his oratory made me asham\'d of that, and determin\'d\r\nme to give the silver; and he finish\'d so admirably, that I empty\'d my\r\npocket wholly into the collector\'s dish, gold and all. At this sermon\r\nthere was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting\r\nthe building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be\r\nintended, had, by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came from\r\nhome. Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a\r\nstrong desire to give, and apply\'d to a neighbour who stood near him,\r\nto borrow some money for the purpose. The application was\r\nunfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the company who had\r\nthe firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer was, "_At\r\nany other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but not\r\nnow, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses._"\r\n\r\nSome of Mr. Whitefield\'s enemies affected to suppose that he would\r\napply these collections to his own private emolument; but I, who was\r\nintimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons\r\nand Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity,\r\nbut am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct\r\na perfectly _honest man_; and methinks my testimony in his favour\r\nought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He\r\nus\'d, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the\r\nsatisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere\r\ncivil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.\r\n\r\nThe following instance will show something of the terms on which we\r\nstood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me\r\nthat he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could\r\nlodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr.\r\nBenezet was removed to Germantown. My answer was, "You know my house;\r\nif you can make shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most\r\nheartily welcome." He reply\'d, that if I made that kind offer for\r\nChrist\'s sake, I should not miss of a reward. And I returned, "_Don\'t\r\nlet me be mistaken; it was not for Christ\'s sake, but for your sake._"\r\nOne of our common acquaintance jocosely remark\'d, that, knowing it to\r\nbe the custom of the saints, when they received any favour, to shift\r\nthe burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders, and place\r\nit in heaven, I had contriv\'d to fix it on earth.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted me\r\nabout his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it to\r\nthe establishment of a college.\r\n\r\nHe had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences\r\nso perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great\r\ndistance, especially as his auditories, however numerous, observ\'d the\r\nmost exact silence. He preach\'d one evening from the top of the\r\nCourthouse steps, which are in the middle of Market-street, and on the\r\nwest side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both\r\nstreets were fill\'d with his hearers to a considerable distance. Being\r\namong the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how\r\nfar he could be heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards\r\nthe river; and I found his voice distinct till I came near\r\nFront-street, when some noise in that street obscur\'d it. Imagining\r\nthen a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius, and that\r\nit were fill\'d with auditors, to each of whom I allow\'d two square\r\nfeet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty\r\nthousand. This reconcil\'d me to the newspaper accounts of his having\r\npreach\'d to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to the\r\nancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I had\r\nsometimes doubted.\r\n\r\nBy hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons\r\nnewly compos\'d, and those which he had often preach\'d in the course of\r\nhis travels. His delivery of the latter was so improv\'d by frequent\r\nrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of\r\nvoice, was so perfectly well turn\'d and well plac\'d, that, without\r\nbeing interested in the subject, one could not help being pleas\'d with\r\nthe discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv\'d\r\nfrom an excellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerant\r\npreachers have over those who are stationary, as the latter cannot\r\nwell improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.\r\n\r\nHis writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his\r\nenemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered\r\nin preaching, might have been afterwards explain\'d or qualifi\'d by\r\nsupposing others that might have accompani\'d them, or they might have\r\nbeen deny\'d; but _litera scripta manet_. Critics attack\'d his writings\r\nviolently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the\r\nnumber of his votaries and prevent their increase; so that I am of\r\nopinion if he had never written anything, he would have left behind\r\nhim a much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might\r\nin that case have been still growing, even after his death, as there\r\nbeing nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him\r\na lower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign\r\nfor him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic\r\nadmiration might wish him to have possessed.\r\n\r\nMy business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances\r\ngrowing daily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as\r\nbeing for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring\r\nprovinces. I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, "_that\r\nafter getting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the\r\nsecond_," money itself being of a prolific nature.\r\n\r\nThe partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag\'d to\r\nengage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had\r\nbehaved well, by establishing them with printing-houses in different\r\ncolonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did\r\nwell, being enabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase the\r\ntypes of me and go on working for themselves, by which means several\r\nfamilies were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was\r\nhappy in this, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably,\r\nowing, I think, a good deal to the precaution of having very\r\nexplicitly settled, in our articles, everything to be done by or\r\nexpected from each partner, so that there was nothing to dispute,\r\nwhich precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter into\r\npartnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have for, and\r\nconfidence in each other at the time of the contract, little\r\njealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the\r\ncare and burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with\r\nbreach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and\r\nother disagreeable consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nDEFENSE OF THE PROVINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nI had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being\r\nestablished in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two, things that I\r\nregretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat\r\neducation of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743,\r\ndrew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time,\r\nthinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person\r\nto superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him;\r\nbut he, having more profitable views in the service of the\r\nproprietaries, which succeeded, declin\'d the undertaking; and, not\r\nknowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the\r\nscheme lie awhile dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in\r\nproposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote\r\nfor that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.\r\n\r\nWith respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war\r\nagainst Great Britain, and being at length join\'d by France, which\r\nbrought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continued\r\nendeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly\r\nto pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security of\r\nthe province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what might\r\nbe done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, I\r\nfirst wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I\r\nstated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity\r\nof union and discipline for our defense, and promis\'d to propose in a\r\nfew days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose. The\r\npamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect. I was call\'d upon for the\r\ninstrument of association, and having settled the draft of it with a\r\nfew friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large\r\nbuilding before mentioned. The house was pretty full; I had prepared a\r\nnumber of printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers\'d all over\r\nthe room. I harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper,\r\nand explained it, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerly\r\nsigned, not the least objection being made.\r\n\r\nWhen the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found\r\nabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the\r\ncountry, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand.\r\nThese all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed\r\nthemselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and\r\nmet every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other\r\nparts of military discipline. The women, by subscriptions among\r\nthemselves, provided silk colours, which they presented to the\r\ncompanies, painted with different devices and mottos, which I\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the flags of the Pennsylvania Association, 1747.\r\nDesigned by Franklin and made by the women of Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nThe officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment,\r\nbeing met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I\r\ndeclin\'d that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person,\r\nand man of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos\'d a\r\nlottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town,\r\nand furnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the\r\nbattery was soon erected, the merlons being fram\'d of logs and fill\'d\r\nwith earth. We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not\r\nbeing sufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at the\r\nsame time, our proprietaries for some assistance, tho\' without much\r\nexpectation of obtaining it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and\r\nmyself were sent to New York by the associators, commission\'d to\r\nborrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus\'d us\r\nperemptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was great\r\ndrinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he\r\nsoftened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more\r\nbumpers he advanc\'d to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly\r\nconceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with\r\ntheir carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery,\r\nwhere the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and\r\namong the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I regularly took my turn of duty there as a\r\ncommon soldier"]\r\n\r\nMy activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and\r\ncouncil; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in\r\nevery measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the\r\nassociation. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos\'d to them the\r\nproclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing\r\nof Heaven on our undertaking. They embrac\'d the motion; but, as it was\r\nthe first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no\r\nprecedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New\r\nEngland, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some\r\nadvantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into\r\nGerman,[81] printed in both languages, and divulg\'d thro\' the province.\r\nThis gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of\r\ninfluencing their congregations to join in the association, and it\r\nwould probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace\r\nhad not soon interven\'d.\r\n\r\n    [81] Wm. Penn\'s agents sought recruits for the colony of\r\n    Pennsylvania in the low countries of Germany, and there\r\n    are still in eastern Pennsylvania many Germans,\r\n    inaccurately called Pennsylvania Dutch. Many of them use\r\n    a Germanized English.\r\n\r\nIt was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these\r\naffairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in\r\nthe Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A\r\nyoung gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished\r\nto succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to\r\ndisplace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will,\r\nadvis\'d me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being\r\nturn\'d out. My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of some\r\npublic man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to\r\nrefuse one when offer\'d to him. "I approve," says I, "of his rule, and\r\nwill practice it with a small addition; I shall never _ask_, never\r\n_refuse_, nor ever _resign_ an office. If they will have my office of\r\nclerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I will\r\nnot, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making\r\nreprisals on my adversaries." I heard, however, no more of this; I was\r\nchosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, as\r\nthey dislik\'d my late intimacy with the members of council, who had\r\njoin\'d the governors in all the disputes about military preparations,\r\nwith which the House had long been harass\'d, they might have been\r\npleas\'d if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not care\r\nto displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, and\r\nthey could not well give another reason.\r\n\r\nIndeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was\r\nnot disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir\'d to\r\nassist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than I\r\ncould have imagined, tho\' against offensive war, were clearly for the\r\ndefensive. Many pamphlets _pro and con_ were publish\'d on the subject,\r\nand some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe\r\nconvinc\'d most of their younger people.\r\n\r\nA transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their\r\nprevailing sentiments. It had been propos\'d that we should encourage\r\nthe scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock,\r\nthen about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no\r\nmoney could be dispos\'d of till the next meeting after the proposal.\r\nThe company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were\r\nQuakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually\r\nattended the meeting; but, tho\' we thought that some of the Quakers\r\nwould join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only one\r\nQuaker, Mr. James Morris, appear\'d to oppose the measure. He expressed\r\nmuch sorrow that it had ever been propos\'d, as he said _Friends_ were\r\nall against it, and it would create such discord as might break up the\r\ncompany. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were the\r\nminority, and if _Friends_ were against the measure, and outvoted us,\r\nwe must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit.\r\nWhen the hour for business arriv\'d it was mov\'d to put the vote; he\r\nallow\'d we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us\r\nthat a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of\r\nopposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their\r\nappearing.\r\n\r\nWhile we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen\r\nbelow desir\'d to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two\r\nof our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled\r\nat a tavern just by; that they were determin\'d to come and vote with\r\nus if there should be occasion, which they hop\'d would not be the\r\ncase, and desir\'d we would not call for their assistance if we could\r\ndo without it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them\r\nwith their elders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went\r\nup, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of\r\nanother hour. This Mr. Morris allow\'d to be extreamly fair. Not one of\r\nhis opposing friends appear\'d, at which he express\'d great surprize;\r\nand, at the expiration of the hour, we carri\'d the resolution eight to\r\none; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with\r\nus, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not\r\ninclin\'d to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion\r\nof Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for\r\nthese were all regular members of that society, and in good reputation\r\namong them, and had due notice of what was propos\'d at that meeting.\r\n\r\nThe honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,\r\nwas one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of\r\ndefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. He\r\nput into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for\r\nthe battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn\r\nwholly to that service. He told me the following anecdote of his old\r\nmaster, William Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England,\r\nwhen a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was\r\nwar-time, and their ship was chas\'d by an armed vessel, suppos\'d to be\r\nan enemy. Their captain prepar\'d for defense; but told William Penn,\r\nand his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance,\r\nand they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James\r\nLogan,[82] who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter\'d to a gun. The\r\nsuppos\'d enemy prov\'d a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the\r\nsecretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn\r\nrebuk\'d him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist\r\nin defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of _Friends_,\r\nespecially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof,\r\nbeing before all the company, piqu\'d the secretary, who answer\'d, _"I\r\nbeing thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But thee\r\nwas willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when\r\nthee thought there was danger."_\r\n\r\n    [82] James Logan (1674-1751) came to America with William\r\n    Penn in 1699, and was the business agent for the Penn\r\n    family. He bequeathed his valuable library, preserved at\r\n    his country seat, "Senton", to the city of\r\n    Philadelphia.--Smyth.\r\n\r\nMy being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were\r\nconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the\r\nembarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever\r\napplication was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for\r\nmilitary purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the\r\none hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the\r\nQuakers, on the other, by compliance contrary to their principles;\r\nhence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of\r\ndisguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode\r\nat last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being "_for the\r\nking\'s use_," and never to inquire how it was applied.\r\n\r\nBut, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was\r\nfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when\r\npowder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and\r\nthe government of New England solicited a grant of some from\r\nPennsylvania, which was much urg\'d on the House by Governor Thomas,\r\nthey could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an\r\ningredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three\r\nthousand pounds, to be put into the hands of the governor, and\r\nappropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat or _other\r\ngrain_. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still\r\nfurther embarrassment, advis\'d the governor not to accept provision,\r\nas not being the thing he had demanded; but he repli\'d, "I shall take\r\nthe money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is\r\ngunpowder," which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to\r\nit.[83]\r\n\r\n    [83] See the votes.--_Marg. note_.\r\n\r\nIt was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we\r\nfeared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had\r\nsaid to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, "If we fail, let us\r\nmove the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can\r\nhave no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a\r\ncommittee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is\r\ncertainly a _fire-engine_." "I see," says he, "you have improv\'d by\r\nbeing so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a\r\nmatch for their wheat or _other grain_."\r\n\r\nThese embarrassments that the Quakers suffer\'d from having establish\'d\r\nand published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was\r\nlawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards,\r\nhowever they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me\r\nof what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that\r\nof the Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael\r\nWelfare, soon after it appear\'d. He complain\'d to me that they were\r\ngrievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and\r\ncharg\'d with abominable principles and practices to which they were\r\nutter strangers. I told him this had always been the case with new\r\nsects, and that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin\'d it might be\r\nwell to publish the articles of their belief, and the rules of their\r\ndiscipline. He said that it had been propos\'d among them, but not\r\nagreed to, for this reason: "When we were first drawn together as a\r\nsociety," says he, "it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far\r\nas to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were\r\nerrors; and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real\r\ntruths. From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther\r\nlight, and our principles have been improving, and our errors\r\ndiminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of\r\nthis progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological\r\nknowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of\r\nfaith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin\'d by it, and\r\nperhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement, and our\r\nsuccessors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and\r\nfounders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from."\r\n\r\nThis modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history\r\nof mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all\r\ntruth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man\r\ntraveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the\r\nroad he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and\r\nalso the people in the fields on each side, but near him all appears\r\nclear, tho\' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid\r\nthis kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been\r\ngradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in the\r\nmagistracy, choosing rather to quit their power than their principle.\r\n\r\nIn order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in\r\n1742, invented an open stove[84] for the better warming of rooms, and\r\nat the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in\r\nentering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my\r\nearly friends, who, having an iron-furnace,[85] found the casting of\r\nthe plates for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing\r\nin demand. To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet,\r\nentitled "_An Account of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces;\r\nwherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly\r\nexplained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms\r\ndemonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Use\r\nof them answered and obviated_," etc. This pamphlet had a good effect.\r\nGov\'r. Thomas was so pleas\'d with the construction of this stove, as\r\ndescribed in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the sole\r\nvending of them for a term of years; but I declin\'d it from a\r\nprinciple which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz.,\r\n_That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we\r\nshould be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of\r\nours; and this we should do freely and generously._\r\n\r\n    [84] The Franklin stove is still in use.\r\n\r\n    [85] Warwick Furnace, Chester County, Pennsylvania,\r\n    across the Schuylkill River from Pottstown.\r\n\r\nAn ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,\r\nand working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the\r\nmachine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there,\r\nand made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the\r\nonly instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho\'\r\nnot always with the same success, which I never contested, as having\r\nno desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use\r\nof these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the\r\nneighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SERVICES AND DUTIES\r\n\r\n(1749-1753)\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace being concluded, and the association business therefore at an\r\nend, I turn\'d my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an\r\nacademy. The first step I took was to associate in the design a number\r\nof active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next\r\nwas to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled _Proposals Relating to\r\nthe Education of Youth in Pennsylvania_. This I distributed among the\r\nprincipal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their\r\nminds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a\r\nsubscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paid\r\nin quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg\'d the\r\nsubscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no\r\nless, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication,\r\nnot as an act of mine, but of some _publick-spirited gentlemen_,\r\navoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the\r\npresenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose\r\nout of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr.\r\nFrancis,[86] then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions\r\nfor the government of the academy; which being done and signed, a\r\nhouse was hired, masters engag\'d, and the schools opened, I think, in\r\nthe same year, 1749.\r\n\r\n    [86] Tench Francis, uncle of Sir Philip Francis,\r\n    emigrated from England to Maryland, and became attorney\r\n    for Lord Baltimore. He removed to Philadelphia and was\r\n    attorney-general of Pennsylvania from 1741 to 1755. He\r\n    died in Philadelphia August 16, 1758.--Smyth.\r\n\r\nThe scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and\r\nwe were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with\r\nintention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house\r\nready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our\r\npurpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by the\r\nhearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made\r\nby people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of\r\ntrustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a\r\npredominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time that\r\npredominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of\r\nsuch sect, contrary to the original intention. It was therefore that\r\none of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one\r\nPresbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of\r\nvacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among the\r\ncontributors. The Moravian happen\'d not to please his colleagues, and\r\non his death they resolved to have no other of that sect. The\r\ndifficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, by\r\nmeans of the new choice.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At\r\nlength one mention\'d me, with the observation that I was merely an\r\nhonest man, and of no sect at all, which prevailed with them to chuse\r\nme. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long\r\nsince abat\'d, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh\r\ncontributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other\r\ndebts the building had occasion\'d, which embarrass\'d them greatly.\r\nBeing now a member of both sets of trustees, that for the building and\r\nthat for the academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with\r\nboth, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees\r\nfor the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter\r\nundertaking to discharge the debt, to keep forever open in the\r\nbuilding a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the\r\noriginal intention, and maintain a free-school for the instruction of\r\npoor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the\r\ndebts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the\r\npremises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and\r\ndifferent rooms above and below for the several schools, and\r\npurchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our\r\npurpose, and the scholars remov\'d into the building. The care and\r\ntrouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and\r\nsuperintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro\' it the more\r\ncheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business,\r\nhaving the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest\r\npartner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted,\r\nas he had work\'d for me four years. He took off my hands all care of\r\nthe printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. The\r\npartnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a\r\ncharter from the governor; their funds were increas\'d by contributions\r\nin Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the\r\nAssembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was\r\nestablished the present University of Philadelphia.[87] I have been\r\ncontinued one of its trustees from the beginning, now near forty\r\nyears, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the\r\nyouth who have receiv\'d their education in it, distinguish\'d by their\r\nimprov\'d abilities, serviceable in public stations, and ornaments to\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\n    [87] Later called the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWhen I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I\r\nflatter\'d myself that, by the sufficient tho\' moderate fortune I had\r\nacquir\'d, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for\r\nphilosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence\'s\r\napparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded\r\nin my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now\r\nconsidering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their\r\npurposes, every part of our civil government, and almost at the same\r\ntime, imposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the\r\ncommission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the\r\ncommon council, and soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large\r\nchose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly. This latter station\r\nwas the more agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting\r\nthere to hear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and\r\nwhich were often so unentertaining that I was induc\'d to amuse myself\r\nwith making magic squares or circles, or anything to avoid weariness;\r\nand I conceiv\'d my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing\r\ngood. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not\r\nflatter\'d by all these promotions; it certainly was; for, considering\r\nmy low beginning, they were great things to me; and they were still\r\nmore pleasing, as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public\r\ngood opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited.\r\n\r\nThe office of justice of the peace I try\'d a little, by attending a\r\nfew courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that\r\nmore knowledge of the common law than I possess\'d was necessary to act\r\nin that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing\r\nmyself by my being oblig\'d to attend the higher duties of a legislator\r\nin the Assembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for\r\nten years, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or\r\nsignifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen.\r\nOn taking my seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.\r\n\r\nThe year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at\r\nCarlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that\r\nthey should nominate some of their members, to be join\'d with some\r\nmembers of council, as commissioners for that purpose.[88] The House\r\nnamed the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission\'d, we\r\nwent to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.\r\n\r\n    [88] See the votes to have this more correctly.--_Marg.\r\n    note._\r\n\r\nAs those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very\r\nquarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbade the selling any\r\nliquor to them; and when they complain\'d of this restriction, we told\r\nthem that if they would continue sober during the treaty, we would\r\ngive them plenty of rum when business was over. They promis\'d this,\r\nand they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and the\r\ntreaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutual\r\nsatisfaction. They then claim\'d and received the rum; this was in the\r\nafternoon: they were near one hundred men, women, and children, and\r\nwere lodg\'d in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square, just\r\nwithout the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among them,\r\nthe commissioners walk\'d out to see what was the matter. We found they\r\nhad made a great bonfire in the middle of the square; they were all\r\ndrunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colour\'d\r\nbodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire,\r\nrunning after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by\r\ntheir horrid yellings, form\'d a scene the most resembling our ideas of\r\nhell that could well be imagin\'d; there was no appeasing the tumult,\r\nand we retired to our lodging. At midnight a number of them came\r\nthundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which we took no\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe next day, sensible they had misbehav\'d in giving us that\r\ndisturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their\r\napology. The orator acknowledg\'d the fault, but laid it upon the rum;\r\nand then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying, "_The Great Spirit,\r\nwho made all things, made everything for some use, and whatever use he\r\ndesign\'d anything for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when_\r\n_he made rum, he said, \'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk\r\nwith,\' and it must be so._" And, indeed, if it be the design of\r\nProvidence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for\r\ncultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the\r\nappointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes who\r\nformerly inhabited the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the\r\ncommissioners walk\'d out to see what was the matter"]\r\n\r\nIn 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the\r\nidea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent\r\ndesign, which has been ascrib\'d to me, but was originally his), for\r\nthe reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of\r\nthe province or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring\r\nto procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in\r\nAmerica, and at first not well understood, he met but with small\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no\r\nsuch thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my\r\nbeing concern\'d in it. "For," says he, "I am often ask\'d by those to\r\nwhom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this\r\nbusiness? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I\r\nhave not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not\r\nsubscribe, but say they will consider of it." I enquired into the\r\nnature and probable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a\r\nvery satisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib\'d to it myself, but\r\nengag\'d heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others.\r\nPreviously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the\r\nminds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which\r\nwas my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted.\r\n\r\nThe subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but,\r\nbeginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some\r\nassistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos\'d to petition for\r\nit, which was done. The country members did not at first relish the\r\nproject; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city,\r\nand therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and\r\nthey doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv\'d of it.\r\nMy allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to\r\nleave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by\r\nvoluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant\r\nsupposition, and utterly impossible.\r\n\r\nOn this I form\'d my plan; and, asking leave to bring in a bill for\r\nincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their\r\npetition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was\r\nobtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the\r\nbill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the\r\nimportant clause a conditional one, viz., "And be it enacted, by the\r\nauthority aforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met\r\nand chosen their managers and treasurer, _and shall have raised by\r\ntheir contributions a capital stock of----value_ (the yearly\r\ninterest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the\r\nsick poor in the said hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance,\r\nadvice, and medicines), _and shall make the same appear to the\r\nsatisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being_, that\r\n_then_ it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker, and he is\r\nhereby required, to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the\r\npayment of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to the\r\ntreasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding,\r\nbuilding, and finishing of the same."\r\n\r\nThis condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had\r\noppos\'d the grant, and now conceiv\'d they might have the credit of\r\nbeing charitable without the expense, agreed to its passage; and then,\r\nin soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg\'d the conditional\r\npromise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man\'s\r\ndonation would be doubled; thus the clause work\'d both ways. The\r\nsubscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we\r\nclaim\'d and receiv\'d the public gift, which enabled us to carry the\r\ndesign into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon\r\nerected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful,\r\nand flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political\r\nmanoeuvers, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure,\r\nor wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus\'d myself for\r\nhaving made some use of cunning.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert\r\nTennent[89], came to me with a request that I would assist him in\r\nprocuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to\r\nbe for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the\r\nPresbyterians, who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield.\r\nUnwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too\r\nfrequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus\'d. He\r\nthen desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I\r\nknew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thought it\r\nwould be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance with my\r\nsolicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars, and\r\ntherefore refus\'d also to give such a list. He then desir\'d I would at\r\nleast give him my advice. "That I will readily do," said I; "and, in\r\nthe first place, I advise you to apply to all those whom you know will\r\ngive something; next, to those whom you are uncertain whether they\r\nwill give anything or not, and show them the list of those who have\r\ngiven; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will give\r\nnothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken." He laugh\'d and\r\nthank\'d me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask\'d\r\nof _everybody_, and he obtain\'d a much larger sum than he expected,\r\nwith which he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-house\r\nthat stands in Arch-street.\r\n\r\n    [89] Gilbert Tennent (1703-1764) came to America with his\r\n    father, Rev. William Tennent, and taught for a time in\r\n    the "Log College," from which sprang the College of New\r\n    Jersey.--Smyth.\r\n\r\nOur city, tho\' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets\r\nlarge, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the\r\ndisgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav\'d, and in wet\r\nweather the wheels of heavy carriages plough\'d them into a quagmire,\r\nso that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust\r\nwas offensive. I had liv\'d near what was call\'d the Jersey Market, and\r\nsaw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their\r\nprovisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at\r\nlength pav\'d with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had\r\nfirm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. By\r\ntalking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in\r\ngetting the street pav\'d with stone between the market and the brick\'d\r\nfoot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for some\r\ntime, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the\r\nstreet not being pav\'d, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon\r\nthis pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon\r\ncover\'d with mire, which was not remov\'d, the city as yet having no\r\nscavengers.\r\n\r\nAfter some inquiry, I found a poor, industrious man, who was willing\r\nto undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week,\r\ncarrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours\' doors, for the\r\nsum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and\r\nprinted a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that\r\nmight be obtain\'d by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping\r\nour houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people\'s feet;\r\nthe benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could\r\nmore easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust\r\nblown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to\r\neach house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe\r\nan agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign\'d, and\r\nfor a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were\r\ndelighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the\r\nmarket, it being a convenience to all, and this rais\'d a general\r\ndesire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing\r\nto submit to a tax for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into\r\nthe Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did\r\nnot pass till I was gone,[90] and then with an alteration in the mode\r\nof assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an\r\nadditional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which\r\nwas a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John\r\nClifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one\r\nat his door, that the people were first impress\'d with the idea of\r\nenlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also\r\nbeen ascrib\'d to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but\r\nfollow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the\r\nform of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first\r\nsupply\'d with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these\r\nrespects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not\r\nreadily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg\'d on its\r\ninside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford;\r\ngiving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an\r\naccidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it\r\ntotally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat\r\npanes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices\r\nadmitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this\r\nmeans they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as\r\nthe London lamps do, but continu\'d bright till morning, and an\r\naccidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily\r\nrepair\'d.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes wonder\'d that the Londoners did not, from the effect\r\nholes in the bottom of the globe lamps us\'d at Vauxhall[91] have in\r\nkeeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps.\r\nBut, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate\r\nflame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro\'\r\nthem, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought\r\nof; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the\r\nstreets of London are very poorly illuminated.\r\n\r\n    [90] See votes.\r\n\r\n    [91] Vauxhall Gardens, once a popular and fashionable\r\n    London resort, situated on the Thames above Lambeth. The\r\n    Gardens were closed in 1859, but they will always be\r\n    remembered because of Sir Roger de Coverley\'s visit to\r\n    them in the _Spectator_ and from the descriptions in\r\n    Smollett\'s _Humphry Clinker_ and Thackeray\'s _Vanity\r\n    Fair_.\r\n\r\nThe mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos\'d,\r\nwhen in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have\r\nknown, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ\'d that\r\nthe streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried\r\naway; but it was suffer\'d to accumulate till wet weather reduc\'d it to\r\nmud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that\r\nthere was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with\r\nbrooms, it was with great labour rak\'d together and thrown up into\r\ncarts open above, the sides of which suffered some of the slush at\r\nevery jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the\r\nannoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the\r\ndusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops\r\nand houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch\r\nbroom"]\r\n\r\nAn accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be\r\ndone in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street,[92] one\r\nmorning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she\r\nappeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness.\r\nI ask\'d who employ\'d her to sweep there; she said, "Nobody, but I am\r\nvery poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentle-folkses doors,\r\nand hopes they will give me something." I bid her sweep the whole\r\nstreet clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine\r\no\'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at\r\nfirst in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done so\r\nsoon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole\r\nstreet was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac\'d in the\r\ngutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash\'d it quite\r\naway, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean.\r\n\r\n    [92] A short street near Charing Cross, London.\r\n\r\nI then judg\'d that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in\r\nthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.\r\nAnd here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in\r\nsuch a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on\r\neach side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a\r\nstreet runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a\r\ncurrent strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when\r\ndivided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and\r\nonly makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of\r\ncarriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement,\r\nwhich is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it\r\nupon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good\r\ndoctor, was as follows:\r\n\r\n"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of\r\nLondon and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be\r\ncontracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud\r\nrak\'d up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of his\r\nround; that they be furnish\'d with brooms and other proper instruments\r\nfor these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to\r\nfurnish the poor people they may employ in the service.\r\n\r\n"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at\r\nproper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually\r\nopened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also\r\ncarry it all away.\r\n\r\n"That the mud, when rak\'d up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad\r\nagain by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the\r\nscavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac\'d high upon\r\nwheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being\r\ncover\'d with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit\r\nthe water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water\r\nmaking the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be\r\nplac\'d at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in\r\nwheelbarrows; they remaining where plac\'d till the mud is drain\'d, and\r\nthen horses brought to draw them away."\r\n\r\nI have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of\r\nthis proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the\r\ndifficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too\r\nmuch the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring\r\nthe dust to be swept up and carry\'d away before the shops are open, is\r\nvery practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in\r\nwalking thro\' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven\r\no\'clock, I observ\'d there was not one shop open, tho\' it had been\r\ndaylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London\r\nchusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by\r\nsunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on\r\ncandles, and the high price of tallow.\r\n\r\nSome may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating;\r\nbut when they consider that tho\' dust blown into the eyes of a single\r\nperson, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small\r\nimportance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city,\r\nand its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps\r\nthey will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to\r\naffairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produced not\r\nso much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by\r\nlittle advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor\r\nyoung man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may\r\ncontribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a\r\nthousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only\r\nremaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he\r\nescapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their\r\nsometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves\r\nwhen most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its\r\nbeing done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I have\r\nhazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which\r\nsome time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many\r\nyears in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America.\r\n\r\nHaving been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of\r\nAmerica as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing\r\nthe officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed,\r\njointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from\r\nthe postmaster-general in England. The American office never had\r\nhitherto paid anything to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred\r\npounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits\r\nof the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary;\r\nsome of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first\r\nfour years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us.\r\nBut it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac\'d by a\r\nfreak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had\r\nbrought it to yield _three times_ as much clear revenue to the crown\r\nas the post-office of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they\r\nhave receiv\'d from it--not one farthing!\r\n\r\nThe business of the post-office occasion\'d my taking a journey this\r\nyear to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own\r\nmotion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College,\r\nin Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without\r\nstudying in any college, I came to partake of their honours. They were\r\nconferr\'d in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the\r\nelectric branch of natural philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nALBANY PLAN OF UNION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of\r\ncommissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the\r\nLords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the\r\nchiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their\r\ncountry and ours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv\'d this order,\r\nacquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper\r\npresents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the\r\nspeaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr.\r\nSecretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House\r\napprov\'d the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and\r\ntho\' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met\r\nthe other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.\r\n\r\nIn our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all\r\nthe colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for\r\ndefense, and other important general purposes. As we pass\'d thro\' New\r\nYork, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr.\r\nKennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and,\r\nbeing fortified by their approbation, I ventur\'d to lay it before the\r\nCongress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners had\r\nform\'d plans of the same kind. A previous question was first taken,\r\nwhether a union should be established, which pass\'d in the affirmative\r\nunanimously. A committee was then appointed, one member from each\r\ncolony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine happen\'d to be\r\npreferr\'d, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOIN, or DIE.]\r\n\r\nBy this plan the general government was to be administered by a\r\npresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand\r\ncouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the\r\nseveral colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon\r\nit in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business.\r\nMany objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were\r\nall overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies\r\nordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies\r\nof the several provinces. Its fate was singular; the assemblies did\r\nnot adopt it, as they all thought there was too much _prerogative_ in\r\nit, and in England it was judg\'d to have too much of the _democratic_.\r\nThe Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it\r\nfor the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form\'d,\r\nsupposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of\r\nthe provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to\r\nmeet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to\r\ndraw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was\r\nafterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on\r\nAmerica. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found\r\namong my political papers that are printed.\r\n\r\nBeing the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with\r\nGovernor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us\r\non the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and\r\ncontrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was\r\nreally the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been\r\nhappy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies,\r\nso united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended\r\nthemselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England;\r\nof course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody\r\ncontest it occasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are\r\nnot new; history is full of the errors of states and princes.\r\n\r\n  "Look round the habitable world, how few\r\n   Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!"\r\n\r\nThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not\r\ngenerally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into\r\nexecution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom\r\n_adopted from previous wisdom, but forc\'d by the occasion_.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,\r\nexpressed his approbation of the plan, "as appearing to him to be\r\ndrawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore\r\nrecommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious\r\nattention." The House, however, by the management of a certain member,\r\ntook it up when I happen\'d to be absent, which I thought not very\r\nfair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to\r\nmy no small mortification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nQUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY\r\nGOVERNORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new\r\ngovernor, Mr. Morris, just arriv\'d there from England, with whom I had\r\nbeen before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to\r\nsupersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir\'d with the disputes his proprietary\r\ninstructions subjected him to, had resign\'d. Mr. Morris ask\'d me if I\r\nthought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said,\r\n"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you\r\nwill only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly."\r\n"My dear friend," says he, pleasantly, "how can you advise my avoiding\r\ndisputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest\r\npleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I\r\npromise you I will, if possible, avoid them." He had some reason for\r\nloving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore,\r\ngenerally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been\r\nbrought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming\r\nhis children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while\r\nsitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise;\r\nfor, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting,\r\nand confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They\r\nget victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of\r\nmore use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nIn returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by\r\nwhich it appear\'d that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the\r\nHouse were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle\r\nbetween them as long as he retain\'d the government. I had my share of\r\nit; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put\r\non every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the\r\ncommittees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as\r\nhis messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and,\r\nas he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that,\r\nwhen we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so\r\ngood-natur\'d a man that no personal difference between him and me was\r\noccasion\'d by the contest, and we often din\'d together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "One afternoon, in the height of this\r\npublic quarrel, we met in the street"]\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the\r\nstreet. "Franklin," says he, "you must go home with me and spend the\r\nevening; I am to have some company that you will like;" and, taking me\r\nby the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine,\r\nafter supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir\'d the idea of\r\nSancho Panza,[93] who, when it was proposed to give him a government,\r\nrequested it might be a government of _blacks_, as then, if he could\r\nnot agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who\r\nsat next to me, says, "Franklin, why do you continue to side with\r\nthese damn\'d Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor\r\nwould give you a good price." "The governor," says I, "has not yet\r\n_blacked_ them enough." He, indeed, had laboured hard to blacken the\r\nAssembly in all his messages, but they wip\'d off his colouring as fast\r\nas he laid it on, and plac\'d it, in return, thick upon his own face;\r\nso that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as\r\nMr. Hamilton, grew tir\'d of the contest, and quitted the government.\r\n\r\nThese public quarrels[94] were all at bottom owing to the\r\nproprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to\r\nbe incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible\r\nmeanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the\r\nnecessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act\r\nexpressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to\r\nobserve such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held out\r\nagainst this injustice, tho\' constrained to bend at last. At length\r\nCaptain Denny, who was Governor Morris\'s successor, ventured to\r\ndisobey those instructions; how that was brought about I shall show\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n    [93] The "round, selfish, and self-important" squire of\r\n    Don Quixote in Cervantes\' romance of that name.\r\n\r\n    [94] My acts in Morris\'s time, military, etc.--_Marg.\r\n    note_.\r\n\r\nBut I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some\r\ntransactions to be mention\'d that happened during the administration\r\nof Governor Morris.\r\n\r\nWar being in a manner commenced with France, the government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point,[95] and sent\r\nMr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor\r\nPownall, to New York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly,\r\nknew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy\'s countryman, he appli\'d to me for\r\nmy influence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was\r\nwell received. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid\r\nout in provisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill\r\n(which included this with other sums granted for the use of the\r\ncrown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate\r\nfrom bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, the\r\nAssembly, tho\' very desirous of making their grant to New England\r\neffectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy labored\r\nhard with the governor to obtain his assent, but he was obstinate.\r\n\r\n    [95] On Lake Champlain, ninety miles north of Albany. It\r\n    was captured by the French in 1731, attacked by the\r\n    English in 1755 and 1756, and abandoned by the French in\r\n    1759. It was finally captured from the English by the\r\n    Americans in 1775.\r\n\r\nI then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor,\r\nby orders on the trustees of the Loan office, which, by law, the\r\nAssembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no\r\nmoney at that time in the office, and therefore I propos\'d that the\r\norders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five\r\nper cent. With these orders I suppos\'d the provisions might easily be\r\npurchas\'d. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the\r\nproposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the\r\ncommittee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying\r\nthem was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the\r\nprovince upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise,\r\nwhich being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain\'d instant\r\ncredit, and were not only receiv\'d in payment for the provisions, but\r\nmany money\'d people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those\r\norders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while\r\nupon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they\r\nwere eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be\r\nseen. Thus this important affair was by my means completed. Mr. Quincy\r\nreturn\'d thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home\r\nhighly pleas\'d with this success of his embassy, and ever after bore\r\nfor me the most cordial and affectionate friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nBRADDOCK\'S EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British government, not chusing to permit the union of the\r\ncolonies as propos\'d at Albany, and to trust that union with their\r\ndefense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their\r\nown strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain\'d\r\nof them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular\r\nEnglish troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia,\r\nand thence march\'d to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for\r\ncarriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he\r\nhad conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the\r\nservice, wish\'d me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as\r\npostmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him\r\nthe mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches\r\nbetween him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he\r\nmust necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which they\r\npropos\'d to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey.\r\n\r\nWe found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the\r\nreturn of those he had sent thro\' the back parts of Maryland and\r\nVirginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din\'d\r\nwith him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his\r\nprejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his\r\narrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his\r\noperations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be\r\nobtained were brought in, by which it appear\'d that they amounted only\r\nto twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition.\r\nThe general and all the officers were surpris\'d, declar\'d the\r\nexpedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim\'d against\r\nthe ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of\r\nthe means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one\r\nhundred and fifty waggons being necessary.\r\n\r\nI happen\'d to say I thought it was pity they had not been landed\r\nrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his\r\nwaggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, "Then\r\nyou, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them\r\nfor us; and I beg you will undertake it." I ask\'d what terms were to\r\nbe offer\'d the owners of the waggons, and I was desir\'d to put on\r\npaper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they\r\nwere agreed to, and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar\'d\r\nimmediately. What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I\r\npublish\'d as soon as I arriv\'d at Lancaster, which being, from the\r\ngreat and sudden effect it produc\'d, a piece of some curiosity, I\r\nshall insert it at length, as follows:\r\n\r\n  "Advertisement.\r\n\r\n   "Lancaster, _April_ 26, 1755.\r\n\r\n"Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each\r\nwaggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the\r\nservice of his majesty\'s forces now about to rendezvous at Will\'s\r\nCreek, and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to\r\nempower me to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice\r\nthat I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to\r\nnext Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morning till\r\nFriday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams,\r\nor single horses, on the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall be\r\npaid for each waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen\r\nshillings per diem; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or\r\nother saddle and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able\r\nhorse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the pay\r\ncommence from the time of their joining the forces at Will\'s Creek,\r\nwhich must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing, and that a\r\nreasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for\r\ntheir travelling to Will\'s Creek and home again after their discharge.\r\n3. Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to be\r\nvalued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and in\r\ncase of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service,\r\nthe price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4.\r\nSeven days\' pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner\r\nof each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if\r\nrequired, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the\r\npaymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to\r\ntime, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of waggons, or persons\r\ntaking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called upon\r\nto do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in\r\nconducting or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats,\r\nIndian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp,\r\nmore than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to be\r\ntaken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n"Note.--My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like\r\ncontracts with any person in Cumberland county.\r\n\r\n"B. Franklin."\r\n\r\n\r\n  _"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster,\r\n           York, and Cumberland._\r\n\r\n"Friends and Countrymen,\r\n\r\n"Being occasionally[96] at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I\r\nfound the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of\r\ntheir not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been\r\nexpected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but,\r\nthrough the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had\r\nnot been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.\r\n\r\n    [96] By chance.\r\n\r\n"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these\r\ncounties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should\r\nbe wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would be\r\nnecessary to drive and take care of them.\r\n\r\n"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these\r\ncounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they\r\nare in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many\r\nand great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more\r\nwillingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair\r\nand equitable means. The people of these back counties have lately\r\ncomplained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you\r\nhave an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very\r\nconsiderable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should\r\ncontinue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and\r\ntwenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to\r\nupward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and\r\ngold of the king\'s money.\r\n\r\n"The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march\r\nabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as\r\nthey carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare\r\nof the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the\r\narmy\'s sake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a\r\nmarch or in a camp.\r\n\r\n"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to\r\nhis majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it\r\neasy to yourselves; for three or four of such as cannot separately\r\nspare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses\r\nand a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another\r\none or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the pay\r\nproportionately between you; but if you do not this service to your\r\nking and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms\r\nare offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected. The\r\nking\'s business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far for\r\nyour defense, must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what\r\nmay be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be had;\r\nviolent measures will probably be used, and you will be left to seek\r\nfor a recompense where you can find it, and your case, perhaps, be\r\nlittle pitied or regarded.\r\n\r\n"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the\r\nsatisfaction of endeavouring to do good, I shall have only my labour\r\nfor my pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is\r\nnot likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in\r\nfourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a\r\nbody of soldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose,\r\nwhich I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly\r\nyour friend and well-wisher,\r\n\r\n"B. Franklin."\r\n\r\nI received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed\r\nin advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum being\r\ninsufficient, I advanc\'d upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two\r\nweeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and\r\nfifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The\r\nadvertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any\r\nwaggon or horse should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did\r\nnot know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on his\r\npromise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly\r\ngave them.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of\r\nColonel Dunbar\'s regiment, he represented to me his concern for the\r\nsubalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could\r\nill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be\r\nnecessary in so long a march, thro\' a wilderness, where nothing was to\r\nbe purchas\'d. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavour\r\nprocuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my\r\nintention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the\r\nAssembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmly\r\nrecommending the case of these officers to their consideration, and\r\nproposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and\r\nrefreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of\r\nits wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos\'d in my letter. The\r\ncommittee approv\'d, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son,\r\nthe stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons. They consisted\r\nof twenty parcels, each containing\r\n\r\n6 lbs. loaf sugar.\r\n6 lbs. good Muscovado do.\r\n1 lb. good green tea.\r\n1 lb. good bohea do.\r\n6 lbs. good ground coffee.\r\n6 lbs. chocolate.\r\n1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.\r\n1-2 lb. pepper.\r\n1 quart best white wine\r\nvinegar.\r\n1 Gloucester cheese.\r\n1 kegg containing 20 lbs.\r\ngood butter.\r\n2 doz. old Madeira wine.\r\n2 gallons Jamaica spirits.\r\n1 bottle flour of mustard.\r\n2 well-cur\'d hams.\r\n1-2 dozen dry\'d tongues.\r\n6 lbs. rice.\r\n6 lbs. raisins.\r\n\r\nThese twenty parcels, well pack\'d, were placed on as many horses, each\r\nparcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer.\r\nThey were very thankfully receiv\'d, and the kindness acknowledg\'d by\r\nletters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most\r\ngrateful terms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct\r\nin procuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of\r\ndisbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther\r\nassistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, and\r\nwas busily employ\'d in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for\r\nthe service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling,\r\nof which I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me,\r\na few days before the battle, and he return\'d me immediately an order\r\non the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the\r\nremainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck,\r\nhaving never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThis general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a\r\nfigure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much\r\nself-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular\r\ntroops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George\r\nCroghan, our Indian interpreter, join\'d him on his march with one\r\nhundred of those people, who might have been of great use to his army\r\nas guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; but he\r\nslighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his\r\nintended progress. "After taking Fort Duquesne,"[97] says he, "I am to\r\nproceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac,[98] if the\r\nseason will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly\r\ndetain me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can\r\nobstruct my march to Niagara." Having before revolv\'d in my mind the\r\nlong line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road, to\r\nbe cut for them thro\' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read\r\nof a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois\r\ncountry, I had conceiv\'d some doubts and some fears for the event of\r\nthe campaign. But I ventur\'d only to say, "To be sure, sir, if you\r\narrive well before Duquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided\r\nwith artillery, that place not yet completely fortified, and as we\r\nhear with no very strong garrison, can probably make but a short\r\nresistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march\r\nis from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, are\r\ndexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, near\r\nfour miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be\r\nattack\'d by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread into\r\nseveral pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up in time to\r\nsupport each other."\r\n\r\n    [97] Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n    [98] Kingston, at the eastern end of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nHe smil\'d at my ignorance, and reply\'d, "These savages may, indeed, be\r\na formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king\'s\r\nregular and disciplin\'d troops, sir, it is impossible they should make\r\nany impression." I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing\r\nwith a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more.\r\nThe enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I\r\napprehended its long line of march expos\'d it to, but let it advance\r\nwithout interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then,\r\nwhen more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front\r\nhad halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the\r\nwoods than any it had pass\'d, attack\'d its advanced guard by heavy\r\nfire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence\r\nthe general had of an enemy\'s being near him. This guard being\r\ndisordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance,\r\nwhich was done in great confusion, thro\' waggons, baggage, and cattle;\r\nand presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on\r\nhorseback, were more easily distinguish\'d, pick\'d out as marks, and\r\nfell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle,\r\nhaving or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till\r\ntwo-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz\'d with a panick,\r\nthe whole fled with precipitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your\r\nmarch is from ambuscades of Indians"]\r\n\r\nThe waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper\'d; their\r\nexample was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons,\r\nprovisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general,\r\nbeing wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr.\r\nShirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers,\r\nsixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men\r\nkilled out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men\r\nfrom the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel\r\nDunbar, who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores,\r\nprovisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being pursu\'d, arriv\'d at\r\nDunbar\'s camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz\'d\r\nhim and all his people; and, tho\' he had now above one thousand men,\r\nand the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four\r\nhundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding, and\r\nendeavouring to recover some of the lost honour, he ordered all the\r\nstores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy\'d, that he might have more\r\nhorses to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumber\r\nto remove. He was there met with requests from the governors of\r\nVirginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his troops on\r\nthe frontier, so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants; but\r\nhe continued his hasty march thro\' all the country, not thinking\r\nhimself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia, where the inhabitants\r\ncould protect him. This whole transaction gave us Americans the first\r\nsuspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regulars\r\nhad not been well founded.[99]\r\n\r\n    [99] Other accounts of this expedition and defeat may be\r\n    found in Fiske\'s _Washington and his Country_, or\r\n    Lodge\'s _George Washington_, Vol. 1.\r\n\r\nIn their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the\r\nsettlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally\r\nruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining\r\nthe people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of\r\nconceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different\r\nwas the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march\r\nthro\' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to\r\nVirginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest\r\ncomplaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.\r\n\r\nCaptain Orme, who was one of the general\'s aids-de-camp, and, being\r\ngrievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu\'d with him\r\nto his death, which happen\'d in a few days, told me that he was\r\ntotally silent all the first day, and at night only said, "_Who would\r\nhave thought it?_" That he was silent again the following day, saying\r\nonly at last, "_We shall better know how to deal with them another\r\ntime_"; and dy\'d in a few minutes after.\r\n\r\nThe secretary\'s papers, with all the general\'s orders, instructions,\r\nand correspondence, falling into the enemy\'s hands, they selected and\r\ntranslated into French a number of the articles, which they printed,\r\nto prove the hostile intentions of the British court before the\r\ndeclaration of war. Among these I saw some letters of the general to\r\nthe ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the\r\narmy, and recommending me to their notice. David Hume,[100] too, who was\r\nsome years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France,\r\nand afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he\r\nhad seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly\r\nrecommending me. But, the expedition having been unfortunate, my\r\nservice, it seems, was not thought of much value, for those\r\nrecommendations were never of any use to me.\r\n\r\n    [100] A famous Scotch philosopher and historian\r\n    (1711-1776).\r\n\r\nAs to rewards from himself, I ask\'d only one, which was, that he would\r\ngive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought\r\nservants, and that he would discharge such as had been already\r\nenlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordingly\r\nreturn\'d to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command\r\ndevolv\'d on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his\r\nretreat, or rather flight, I apply\'d to him for the discharge of the\r\nservants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had\r\nenlisted, reminding him of the late general\'s orders on that head. He\r\npromised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where\r\nhe should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there\r\ndeliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and\r\ntrouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus\'d to perform his\r\npromise, to their great loss and disappointment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all\r\nthe owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to\r\npay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting\r\nthem that the money was ready in the paymaster\'s hands, but that\r\norders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,[101]\r\nand my assuring them that I had apply\'d to that general by letter;\r\nbut, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv\'d, and\r\nthey must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and\r\nsome began to sue me. General Shirley at length relieved me from this\r\nterrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims,\r\nand ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound,\r\nwhich to pay would have ruined me.\r\n\r\n    [101] Governor of Massachusetts and commander of the\r\n    British forces in America.\r\n\r\nBefore we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me\r\nwith a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a\r\ngrand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on\r\nreceipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, and\r\nsaid it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing\r\nwhen we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem\'d surpris\'d\r\nthat I did not immediately comply with their proposal. "Why the\r\nd----l!" says one of them, "you surely don\'t suppose that the\r\nfort will not be taken?" "I don\'t know that it will not be taken, but\r\nI know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty." I\r\ngave them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and\r\nthe projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have\r\nundergone if the firework had been prepared. Dr. Bond, on some other\r\noccasion afterward, said that he did not like Franklin\'s forebodings.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message\r\nafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the\r\nmaking of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without\r\ntaxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all\r\ntheir bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his\r\nattacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being\r\ngreater. The Assembly, however, continu\'d firm, believing they had\r\njustice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential\r\nright if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one\r\nof the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his\r\npropos\'d amendment was only of a single word. The bill express\'d "that\r\nall estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the\r\nproprietaries _not_ excepted." His amendment was, for _not_ read\r\n_only_: a small, but very material alteration. However, when the news\r\nof this disaster reached England, our friends there whom we had taken\r\ncare to furnish with all the Assembly\'s answers to the governor\'s\r\nmessages, rais\'d a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness\r\nand injustice in giving their governor such instructions; some going\r\nso far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province,\r\nthey forfeited their right to it. They were intimidated by this, and\r\nsent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of\r\ntheir money to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThis, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share\r\nof a general tax, and a new bill was form\'d, with an exempting clause,\r\nwhich passed accordingly. By this act I was appointed one of the\r\ncommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I had\r\nbeen active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had,\r\nat the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a\r\nvoluntary militia, which I carried thro\' the House without much\r\ndifficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their\r\nliberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I\r\nwrote a dialogue,[102] stating and answering all the objections I could\r\nthink of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought,\r\ngreat effect.\r\n\r\n    [102] This dialogue and the militia act are in the\r\n    Gentleman\'s Magazine for February and March,\r\n    1756.--_Marg. note._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN\'S DEFENSE OF THE\r\nFRONTIER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the several companies in the city and country were forming, and\r\nlearning their exercise, the governor prevail\'d with me to take charge\r\nof our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and\r\nprovide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and\r\nbuilding a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho\' I\r\ndid not conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission\r\nwith full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to\r\nbe given to whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising\r\nmen, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who\r\nhad in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais\'d against\r\nCanada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had\r\nburned Gnadenhut,[103] a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred\r\nthe inhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of\r\nthe forts.\r\n\r\n    [103] Pronounced Gna\xc2\xb4-den-hoot.\r\n\r\nIn order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the\r\nchief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in so\r\ngood a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them\r\napprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade;\r\nthey had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York,\r\nand had even plac\'d quantities of small paving stones between the\r\nwindows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon\r\nthe heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. The\r\narmed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev\'d as methodically as in\r\nany garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I\r\nmention\'d this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of\r\nParliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had\r\nsuppos\'d they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He\r\nanswer\'d me that it was not one of their established principles, but\r\nthat, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a\r\nprinciple with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they,\r\nto their surprise, found it adopted by but a few. It seems they were\r\neither deceiv\'d in themselves, or deceiv\'d the Parliament; but common\r\nsense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for\r\nwhimsical opinions.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of\r\nbuilding forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with\r\ninstructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the\r\ncountry, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and\r\nI concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where\r\na fort was tho\'t more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur\'d me\r\nfive waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.\r\n\r\nJust before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven\r\nfrom their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply\r\nof firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I\r\ngave them each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march\'d many\r\nmiles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there\r\nwere no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv\'d near\r\nnight at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all\r\nhuddled together, as wet as water could make us. It was well we were\r\nnot attack\'d in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinary\r\nsort, and our men could not keep their gun locks[104] dry. The Indians\r\nare dexterous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. They\r\nmet that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten\r\nof them. The one who escap\'d inform\'d that his and his companions\'\r\nguns would not go off, the priming being wet with the rain.\r\n\r\n    [104] Flint-lock guns, discharged by means of a spark\r\n    struck from flint and steel into powder (priming) in an\r\n    open pan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "We had not march\'d many miles before it began to rain"]\r\n\r\nThe next day being fair, we continu\'d our march, and arriv\'d at the\r\ndesolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left\r\nseveral piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an\r\noperation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no\r\ntents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found\r\nthere, who had been half interr\'d by the country people.\r\n\r\nThe next morning our fort was plann\'d and mark\'d out, the\r\ncircumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would\r\nrequire as many palisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a\r\nfoot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were\r\nimmediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being\r\ndexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the\r\ntrees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two\r\nmen began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the\r\nground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made\r\nthree palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these\r\nwere preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet\r\ndeep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the\r\nbodies being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated\r\nby taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,[105] we\r\nhad ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from\r\nthe woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a\r\nstage\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Our axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down\r\ntrees"]\r\n\r\nof boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand\r\non when to fire thro\' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we\r\nmounted on one of the angles, and fir\'d it as soon as fix\'d, to let\r\nthe Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces;\r\nand thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so\r\nmiserable a stockade, was finish\'d in a week, though it rain\'d so hard\r\nevery other day that the men could not work.\r\n\r\n    [105] Here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels\r\n    of a wagon.\r\n\r\nThis gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ\'d, they\r\nare best content\'d; for on the days they worked they were good-natur\'d\r\nand cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day\'s\r\nwork, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were\r\nmutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread,\r\netc., and in continual ill-humour, which put me in mind of a\r\nsea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work;\r\nand, when his mate once told him that they had done everything, and\r\nthere was nothing further to employ them about, _"Oh," says he, "make\r\nthem scour the anchor."_\r\n\r\nThis kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense\r\nagainst Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted\r\nsecurely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur\'d\r\nout in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians,\r\nbut we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain\r\nto watch our proceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of\r\nthose places that seems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was\r\nnecessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the ground\r\nwould by its light have discover\'d their position at a distance. They\r\nhad therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and\r\nsomewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the\r\ncharcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With these\r\ncoals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and we\r\nobserv\'d among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made by\r\ntheir laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to\r\nkeep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point. This\r\nkind of fire, so manag\'d, could not discover them, either by its\r\nlight, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear\'d that their number was\r\nnot great, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by\r\nthem with prospect of advantage.\r\n\r\nWe had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty,\r\nwho complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers\r\nand exhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay\r\nand provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv\'d out\r\nto them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I\r\nobserved they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which\r\nI said to Mr. Beatty, "It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your\r\nprofession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it\r\nout and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you."\r\nHe liked the tho\'t, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few\r\nhands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and\r\nnever were prayers more generally and more punctually attended; so\r\nthat I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by\r\nsome military laws for non-attendance on divine service.\r\n\r\nI had hardly finish\'d this business, and got my fort well stor\'d with\r\nprovisions, when I receiv\'d a letter from the governor, acquainting me\r\nthat he had call\'d the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if\r\nthe posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining\r\nthere was no longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly,\r\npressing me by their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and\r\nmy three intended forts being now compleated, and the inhabitants\r\ncontented to remain on their farms under that protection, I resolved\r\nto return; the more willingly, as a New England officer, Colonel\r\nClapham, experienced in Indian war, being on a visit to our\r\nestablishment, consented to accept the command. I gave him a\r\ncommission, and, parading the garrison, had it read before them, and\r\nintroduc\'d him to them as an officer who, from his skill in military\r\naffairs, was much more fit to command them than myself; and, giving\r\nthem a little exhortation, took my leave. I was escorted as far as\r\nBethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I had\r\nundergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I could hardly sleep,\r\nit was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at\r\nGnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.\r\n\r\nWhile at Bethlehem, I inquir\'d a little into the practice of the\r\nMoravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to\r\nme. I found they work\'d for a common stock, ate at common tables, and\r\nslept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the\r\ndormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just\r\nunder the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of\r\nair. I was at their church, where I was entertain\'d with good musick,\r\nthe organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets,\r\netc. I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to\r\nmixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our common\r\npractice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other\r\ntimes their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the little\r\nchildren, each division by itself. The sermon I heard was to the\r\nlatter, who came in and were plac\'d in rows on benches; the boys under\r\nthe conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a\r\nyoung woman. The discourse seem\'d well adapted to their capacities,\r\nand was delivered in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it\r\nwere, to be good. They behav\'d very orderly, but looked pale and\r\nunhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors,\r\nor not allow\'d sufficient exercise.\r\n\r\nI inquir\'d concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was\r\ntrue that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us\'d only in\r\nparticular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself\r\ndispos\'d to marry, he inform\'d the elders of his class, who consulted\r\nthe elder ladies that govern\'d the young women. As these elders of the\r\ndifferent sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions\r\nof their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were\r\nsuitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc\'d in; but if,\r\nfor example, it should happen that two or three young women were found\r\nto be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to.\r\nI objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the\r\nparties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. "And so they\r\nmay," answer\'d my informer, "if you let the parties chuse for\r\nthemselves;" which, indeed, I could not deny.\r\n\r\nBeing returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on\r\nswimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty\r\ngenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose\r\ntheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law.\r\nDr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to\r\nspread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those\r\nendeavours. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my _Dialogue_;\r\nhowever, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him\r\nenjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such\r\ncases. The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment,\r\nwhich I this time accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we\r\nparaded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of\r\nartillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which\r\nthey had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a\r\nminute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to\r\nmy house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door,\r\nwhich shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.\r\nAnd my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all our\r\ncommissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.\r\n\r\nDuring this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a\r\njourney to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their\r\nheads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as\r\nfar as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they came\r\nto my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their\r\nuniforms. I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or I\r\nshould have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of\r\nstate on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin\'d at their\r\nappearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me. What made it\r\nworse was, that, as soon as we began to move, they drew their swords\r\nand rode with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of\r\nthis to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such honour\r\nhad been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his governors;\r\nand he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal, which\r\nmay be true for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the\r\netiquette in such cases.\r\n\r\nThis silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me,\r\nwhich was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the\r\nAssembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I\r\nhad always oppos\'d very warmly, and not without severe reflections on\r\nhis meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the\r\nministry as being the great obstacle to the King\'s service,\r\npreventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills\r\nfor raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a\r\nproof of my having an intention to take the government of the province\r\nout of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener,\r\nthe postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no\r\nother effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the\r\nHouse, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still\r\nsubsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, and\r\nwe never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thought\r\nthat his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was\r\nknown I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional\r\nhabit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as\r\nmerely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the\r\nproprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes\r\ncall in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and\r\nsometimes, tho\' not often, take my advice.\r\n\r\nWe acted in concert to supply Braddock\'s army with provisions; and,\r\nwhen the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in\r\nhaste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the\r\ndesertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I\r\nthink it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail\'d with, if\r\npossible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection,\r\ntill, by reinforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed\r\non the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would\r\nhave had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with\r\nprovincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his\r\nmen being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as\r\ngeneral. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he\r\nprofess\'d to have, and I believe his professions must have exceeded\r\nhis real sentiments; but probably he might think that my popularity\r\nwould facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly,\r\nthe grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the\r\nproprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as he\r\nexpected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the\r\ngovernment, being superseded by Captain Denny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under\r\nthis new governor\'s administration, it may not be amiss here to give\r\nsome account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was\r\nlately arrived from Scotland, and show\'d me some electric experiments.\r\nThey were imperfectly perform\'d, as he was not very expert; but, being\r\non a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris\'d and pleased me.\r\nSoon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv\'d\r\nfrom Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society[106] of London, a\r\npresent of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it in making\r\nsuch experiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I\r\nhad seen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquired great readiness in\r\nperforming those, also, which we had an account of from England,\r\nadding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house was\r\ncontinually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new\r\nwonders.\r\n\r\n    [106] The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural\r\n    Knowledge was founded in 1660 and holds the foremost\r\n    place among English societies for the advancement of\r\n    science.\r\n\r\nTo divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a\r\nnumber of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which\r\nthey furnish\'d themselves, so that we had at length several\r\nperformers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an\r\ningenious neighbour, who, being out of business, I encouraged to\r\nundertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two\r\nlectures, in which the experiments were rang\'d in such order, and\r\naccompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the\r\nforegoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur\'d an\r\nelegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machines\r\nthat I had roughly made for myself were nicely form\'d by\r\ninstrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great\r\nsatisfaction; and after some time he went thro\' the colonies,\r\nexhibiting them in every capital town, and pick\'d up some money. In\r\nthe West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments\r\ncould be made, from the general moisture of the air.\r\n\r\nOblig\'d as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc.,\r\nI thought it right he should be inform\'d of our success in using it,\r\nand wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments.\r\nHe got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first\r\nthought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions.\r\nOne paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of\r\nlightning with electricity,[107] I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance\r\nof mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote me\r\nword that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs.\r\nThe papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of\r\ntoo much value to be stifled, and advis\'d the printing of them. Mr.\r\nCollinson then gave them to _Cave_ for publication in his Gentleman\'s\r\nMagazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr.\r\nFothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his\r\nprofit, for by the additions that arrived afterward, they swell\'d to a\r\nquarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for\r\ncopy-money.\r\n\r\n    [107] See page 327.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice\r\nof in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the\r\nCount de Buffon,[108] a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in\r\nFrance, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard[109]\r\nto translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. The\r\npublication offended the Abb\xc3\xa9 Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy\r\nto the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form\'d and\r\npublish\'d a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue.\r\nHe could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and\r\nsaid it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry\r\nhis system. Afterwards, having been assur\'d that there really existed\r\nsuch a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he\r\nwrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address\'d to me,\r\ndefending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and of\r\nthe positions deduc\'d from them.\r\n\r\n    [108] A celebrated French naturalist (1707-1788).\r\n\r\n    [109] Dalibard, who had translated Franklin\'s letters to\r\n    Collinson into French, was the first to demonstrate, in\r\n    a practical application of Franklin\'s experiment, that\r\n    lightning and electricity are the same. "This was May\r\n    10th, 1752, one month before Franklin flew his famous\r\n    kite at Philadelphia and proved the fact\r\n    himself."--McMaster.\r\n\r\nI once purpos\'d answering the abb\xc3\xa9, and actually began the answer;\r\nbut, on consideration that my writings contained a description of\r\nexperiments which anyone might repeat and verify, and if not to be\r\nverifi\'d, could not be defended; or of observations offer\'d as\r\nconjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me\r\nunder any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute\r\nbetween two persons, writing in different languages, might be\r\nlengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions of\r\none another\'s meaning, much of one of the abb\xc3\xa9\'s letters being founded\r\non an error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift for\r\nthemselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could spare\r\nfrom public business in making new experiments, than in disputing\r\nabout those already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and\r\nthe event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le\r\nRoy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted\r\nhim; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin\r\nlanguages; and the doctrine it contain\'d was by degrees universally\r\nadopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except\r\nMonsieur B----, of Paris, his _\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ve_ and immediate disciple.\r\n\r\nWhat gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the\r\nsuccess of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard\r\nand De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This\r\nengag\'d the public attention everywhere. M. de Lor, who had an\r\napparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur\'d in that branch of\r\nscience, undertook to repeat what he called the _Philadelphia\r\nExperiments_; and, after they were performed before the king and\r\ncourt, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell\r\nthis narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the\r\ninfinite pleasure I receiv\'d in the success of a similar one I made\r\nsoon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the\r\nhistories of electricity.\r\n\r\nDr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend,\r\nwho was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my\r\nexperiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that\r\nmy writings had been so little noticed in England. The society, on\r\nthis, resum\'d the consideration of the letters that had been read to\r\nthem; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them,\r\nand of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject, which he\r\naccompanied with some praise of the writer. This summary was then\r\nprinted in their Transactions; and some members of the society in\r\nLondon, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified\r\nthe experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed\r\nrod, and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more\r\nthan amends for the slight with which they had before treated me.\r\nWithout my having made any application for that honour, they chose me\r\na member, and voted that I should be excus\'d the customary payments,\r\nwhich would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever since have\r\ngiven me their Transactions gratis. They also presented me with the\r\ngold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley[110] for the year 1753, the delivery of\r\nwhich was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president, Lord\r\nMacclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured.\r\n\r\n    [110] An English baronet (died in 1709), donator of a fund\r\n    of \xc2\xa3100, "in trust for the Royal Society of London for\r\n    improving natural knowledge."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nAGENT OF PENNSYLVANIA IN\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nOur new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the\r\nbefore mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to\r\nme at an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it with\r\nvery polite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been\r\nlong acquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, as\r\nwas customary at that time, were engag\'d in drinking, he took me aside\r\ninto another room, and acquainted me that he had been advis\'d by his\r\nfriends in England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was\r\ncapable of giving him the best advice, and of contributing most\r\neffectually to the making his administration easy; that he therefore\r\ndesired of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he\r\nbegged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me\r\nevery service that might be in his power. He said much to me, also, of\r\nthe proprietor\'s good disposition towards the province, and of the\r\nadvantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular, if the\r\nopposition that had been so long continu\'d to his measures was dropt,\r\nand harmony restor\'d between him and the people; in effecting which,\r\nit was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself; and I\r\nmight depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc.\r\nThe drinkers, finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent\r\nus a decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and\r\nin proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.\r\n\r\nMy answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God,\r\nwere such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that,\r\nbeing a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any;\r\nthat, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that,\r\nwhenever the public measures he propos\'d should appear to be for the\r\ngood of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more\r\nzealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this,\r\nthat the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to\r\nserve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the\r\npeople; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his\r\nprofessions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in\r\nmy power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at the\r\nsame time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate\r\ninstruction his predecessor had been hampered with.\r\n\r\nOn this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came\r\nto do business with the Assembly, they appear\'d again, the disputes\r\nwere renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the\r\npenman, first, of the request to have a communication of the\r\ninstructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in\r\nthe votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward\r\npublish\'d. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often\r\ntogether; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was\r\nvery entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first\r\ninformation that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was\r\nesteem\'d one of the best political writers in England; had been\r\nemployed in the dispute[111] between Prince Frederic and the king, and\r\nhad obtain\'d a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation\r\nwas indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the\r\n_Dunciad_,[112] but his prose was thought as good as any man\'s.\r\n\r\n    [111] Quarrel between George II and his son, Frederick,\r\n    Prince of Wales, who died before his father.\r\n\r\n    [112] A satirical poem by Alexander Pope directed against\r\n    various contemporary writers.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in\r\nmanacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with\r\nthe privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown,\r\nresolv\'d to petition the king against them, and appointed me their\r\nagent to go over to England, to present and support the petition. The\r\nHouse had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty\r\nthousand pounds for the king\'s use (ten thousand pounds of which was\r\nsubjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the\r\ngovernor absolutely refus\'d to pass, in compliance with his\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nI had agreed with Captain Morris, of the packet at New York, for my\r\npassage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv\'d at\r\nPhiladelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavour an accommodation\r\nbetween the governor and Assembly, that his majesty\'s service might\r\nnot be obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir\'d the\r\ngovernor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be\r\nsaid on both sides. We met and discussed the business. In behalf of\r\nthe Assembly, I urged all the various arguments that may be found in\r\nthe public papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are\r\nprinted with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his\r\ninstructions, the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin if\r\nhe disobey\'d, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord\r\nLoudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not chuse to do, though\r\nI once thought I had nearly prevail\'d with him to do it; but finally\r\nhe rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he\r\nentreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose,\r\ndeclaring that he would spare none of the king\'s troops for the\r\ndefense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to provide\r\nfor that defense ourselves, they must remain expos\'d to the enemy.\r\n\r\nI acquainted the House with what had pass\'d, and, presenting them with\r\na set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we\r\ndid not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the\r\nexercise of them on this occasion thro\' _force_, against which we\r\nprotested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another\r\nconformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course the\r\ngovernor pass\'d, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage.\r\nBut, in the meantime, the packet had sailed with my sea-stores, which\r\nwas some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship\'s thanks\r\nfor my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling\r\nto his share.\r\n\r\nHe set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching\r\nthe packet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then\r\nremaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I\r\nrequested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by any\r\ndelay of mine. His answer was, "I have given out that she is to sail\r\non Saturday next; but I may let you know, _entre nous_, that if you\r\nare there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay\r\nlonger." By some accidental hindrance at a ferry, it was Monday noon\r\nbefore I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the\r\nwind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that she\r\nwas still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. One\r\nwould imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for\r\nEurope. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with his\r\nlordship\'s character, of which _indecision_ was one of the strongest\r\nfeatures. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning of\r\nApril that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of June\r\nbefore we sail\'d. There were then two of the packet-boats, which had\r\nbeen long in port, but were detained for the general\'s letters, which\r\nwere always to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arriv\'d; she too was\r\ndetain\'d; and, before we sail\'d, a fourth was expected. Ours was the\r\nfirst to be dispatch\'d, as having been there longest. Passengers were\r\nengaged in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the\r\nmerchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given\r\nfor insurance (it being war time) for fall goods; but their anxiety\r\navail\'d nothing; his lordship\'s letters were not ready; and yet\r\nwhoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and\r\nconcluded he must needs write abundantly.\r\n\r\nGoing myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his\r\nantechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from\r\nthence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general. He\r\ndelivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion\'d\r\nmy inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg\'d, that I might\r\nsend some letters by him. He told me he was order\'d to call to-morrow\r\nat nine for the general\'s answer to the governor, and should set off\r\nimmediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight\r\nafter I met him again in the same place. "So, you are soon return\'d,\r\nInnis?" "_Return\'d_! no, I am not _gone_ yet." "How so?" "I have\r\ncalled here by order every morning these two weeks past for his\r\nlordship\'s letter, and it is not yet ready." "Is it possible, when he\r\nis so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire."\r\n"Yes," says Innis, "but he is like St. George on the signs, _always on\r\nhorseback, and never rides on_." This observation of the messenger\r\nwas, it seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood that\r\nMr. Pitt[113] gave it as one reason for removing this general, and\r\nsending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, _that the minister never heard\r\nfrom him, and could not know what he was doing_.\r\n\r\n    [113] William Pitt, first Earl of Chatham (1708-1778), a\r\n    great English statesman and orator. Under his able\r\n    administration, England won Canada from France. He was a\r\n    friend of America at the time of our Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets going\r\ndown to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it\r\nbest to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and\r\nthey be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six\r\nweeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig\'d to procure more. At\r\nlength the fleet sail\'d, the general and all his army on board, bound\r\nto Louisburg, with the intent to besiege and take that fortress; all\r\nthe packet-boats in company ordered to attend the general\'s ship,\r\nready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were out\r\nfive days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship\r\nquitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two packets he\r\nstill detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some\r\ntime to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then altered\r\nhis mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York, with all\r\nhis troops, together with the two packets above mentioned, and all\r\ntheir passengers! During his absence the French and savages had taken\r\nFort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had\r\nmassacred many of the garrison after capitulation.\r\n\r\nI saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those\r\npackets. He told me that, when he had been detain\'d a month, he\r\nacquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that\r\nmust necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a\r\npacket-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and\r\nclean her bottom. He was asked how long time that would require. He\r\nanswered, three days. The general replied, "If you can do it in one\r\nday, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day\r\nafter to-morrow." So he never obtain\'d leave, though detained\r\nafterwards from day to day during full three months.\r\n\r\nI saw also in London one of Bonnell\'s passengers, who was so enrag\'d\r\nagainst his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New\r\nYork, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore\r\nhe would sue him for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard;\r\nbut, as he represented the injury to his affairs, it was very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I wonder\'d much how such a man came to be intrusted[114]\r\nwith so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but,\r\nhaving since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining,\r\nand motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General\r\nShirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of\r\nBraddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a\r\nmuch better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was\r\nfrivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception;\r\nfor, tho\' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and\r\nsagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others,\r\ncapable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying\r\nthem into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with\r\nhis great army, left them totally expos\'d while he paraded idly at\r\nHalifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang\'d all\r\nour mercantile operations, and distress\'d our trade, by a long embargo\r\non the exportation of provisions, on pretence of keeping supplies from\r\nbeing obtain\'d by the enemy, but in reality for beating down their\r\nprice in favour of the contractors, in whose profits, it was said,\r\nperhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at length the\r\nembargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to\r\nCharlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain\'d near three months longer,\r\nwhereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great\r\npart of them foundered in their passage home.\r\n\r\n    [114] This relation illustrates the corruption that\r\n    characterized English public life in the eighteenth\r\n    century. (See page 308). It was gradually overcome in\r\n    the early part of the next century.\r\n\r\nShirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so\r\nburdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man\r\nunacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment given\r\nby the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the\r\ncommand. Shirley, tho\' thereby superseded, was present also. There was\r\na great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs\r\nhaving been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among them\r\nvery low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat\r\nby him, I said, "They have given you, sir, too low a seat." "No\r\nmatter," says he, "Mr. Franklin, I find _a low seat_ the easiest."\r\n\r\nWhile I was, as afore mention\'d, detain\'d at New York, I receiv\'d all\r\nthe accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish\'d to\r\nBraddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain\'d from the\r\ndifferent persons I had employ\'d to assist in the business. I\r\npresented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the balance. He\r\ncaus\'d them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, after\r\ncomparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right;\r\nand the balance due for which his lordship promis\'d to give me an\r\norder on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time;\r\nand tho\' I call\'d often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At\r\nlength, just before my departure, he told me he had, on better\r\nconsideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his\r\npredecessors. "And you," says he, "when in England, have only to\r\nexhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\nI mention\'d, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I\r\nhad been put to by being detain\'d so long at New York, as a reason for\r\nmy desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not\r\nright I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the\r\nmoney I had advanc\'d, as I charged no commission for my service, "O,\r\nSir," says he, "you must not think of persuading us that you are no\r\ngainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every one\r\nconcerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill\r\nhis own pockets." I assur\'d him that was not my case, and that I had\r\nnot pocketed a farthing; but he appear\'d clearly not to believe me;\r\nand, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made\r\nin such employments. As to my balance, I am not paid it to\r\nthis day, of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\nOur captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the\r\nswiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved\r\nthe dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After\r\nmany conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship\r\nalmost as dull as ours, which, however, gain\'d upon us, the captain\r\nordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as\r\npossible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we\r\nstood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far\r\nbehind, which prov\'d clearly what our captain suspected, that she was\r\nloaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been\r\nall plac\'d forward; these he therefore order\'d to be mov\'d further\r\naft, on which the ship recover\'d her character, and proved the best\r\nsailer in the fleet.\r\n\r\nThe captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots,\r\nwhich is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a\r\npassenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was\r\nimpossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must\r\nhave been some error in the division of the log-line, or some mistake\r\nin heaving the log.[115] A wager ensu\'d between the two captains, to be\r\ndecided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon\r\nexamin\'d rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi\'d with that, he\r\ndetermin\'d to throw the log himself. Accordingly some days after, when\r\nthe wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the\r\npaquet, Lutwidge, said he believ\'d she then went at the rate of\r\nthirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and own\'d his wager lost.\r\n\r\n    [115] A piece of wood shaped and weighted so as to keep it\r\n    stable when in the water. To this is attached a line\r\n    knotted at regular distances. By these devices it is\r\n    possible to tell the speed of a ship.\r\n\r\nThe above fact I give for the sake of the following observation. It\r\nhas been remark\'d, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building,\r\nthat it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will\r\nor will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing\r\nship has been exactly follow\'d in a new one, which has prov\'d, on the\r\ncontrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be\r\noccasion\'d by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of\r\nlading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the\r\nsame vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shall\r\nsail better or worse than when by the orders of another. Besides, it\r\nscarce ever happens that a ship is form\'d, fitted for the sea, and\r\nsail\'d by the same person. One man builds the hull, another rigs her,\r\na third lades and sails her. No one of these has the advantage of\r\nknowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore,\r\ncannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole.\r\n\r\nEven in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often\r\nobserv\'d different judgments in the officers who commanded the\r\nsuccessive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sails\r\ntrimm\'d sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem\'d to have\r\nno certain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments might\r\nbe instituted; first, to determine the most proper form of the hull\r\nfor swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for\r\nthe masts; then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as\r\nthe wind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is\r\nan age of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin\'d\r\nwould be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some\r\ningenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailing ship]\r\n\r\nWe were several times chas\'d in our passage, but out-sail\'d every\r\nthing, and in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation,\r\nand the captain judg\'d himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we\r\nmade a good run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor\r\nin the morning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of\r\nthe enemy\'s privateers, who often cruis\'d near the entrance of the\r\nchannel. Accordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly\r\nmake, and the wind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it,\r\nand made great way. The captain, after his observation, shap\'d his\r\ncourse, as he thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it\r\nseems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George\'s\r\nChannel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley\r\nShovel\'s squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of what\r\nhappened to us.\r\n\r\nWe had a watchman plac\'d in the bow, to whom they often called, "_Look\r\nwell out before there_," and he as often answered, "_Ay, ay_"; but\r\nperhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they\r\nsometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a\r\nlight just before us, which had been hid by the studding-sails from\r\nthe man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an\r\naccidental yaw of the ship was discover\'d, and occasion\'d a great\r\nalarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as big as a\r\ncartwheel. It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but Captain\r\nKennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to\r\nwear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts,\r\nbut it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running\r\nright upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected. This\r\ndeliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, and\r\nmade me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America if I\r\nshould live to return there.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near\r\nour port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nine\r\no\'clock the fog began to rise, and seem\'d to be lifted up from the\r\nwater like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the\r\ntown of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that\r\nsurrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had\r\nbeen so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a\r\nvacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free\r\nfrom the anxieties which the state of war occasion\'d.\r\n\r\nI set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt a\r\nlittle by the way to view Stonehenge[116] on Salisbury Plain, and Lord\r\nPembroke\'s house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities at\r\nWilton. We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.[117]\r\n\r\n    [116] A celebrated prehistoric ruin, probably of a temple\r\n    built by the early Britons, near Salisbury, England. It\r\n    consists of inner and outer circles of enormous stones,\r\n    some of which are connected by stone slabs.\r\n\r\n    [117] "Here terminates the _Autobiography_, as published\r\n    by Wm. Temple Franklin and his successors. What follows\r\n    was written in the last year of Dr. Franklin\'s life, and\r\n    was never before printed in English."--Mr. Bigelow\'s\r\n    note in his edition of 1868.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me,\r\nI went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended,\r\nand whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis\'d to obtain.\r\nHe was against an immediate complaint to government, and thought the\r\nproprietaries should first be personally appli\'d to, who might\r\npossibly be induc\'d by the interposition and persuasion of some\r\nprivate friends, to accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on my\r\nold friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that\r\nJohn Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requested to be\r\ninformed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord\r\nGranville\'s,[118] who was then President of the Council and wished to\r\nsee me as soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning.\r\nAccordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to\r\nthat nobleman\'s, who receiv\'d me with great civility; and after some\r\nquestions respecting the present state of affairs in America and\r\ndiscourse thereupon, he said to me: "You Americans have wrong ideas of\r\nthe nature of your constitution; you contend that the king\'s\r\ninstructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves at\r\nliberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion. But those\r\ninstructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister\r\ngoing abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of\r\nceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they\r\nare then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after\r\nwhich they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they\r\nrelate to you, the _law of the land_, for the king is the Legislator\r\nof the Colonies,"[119] I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me.\r\nI had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be\r\nmade by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his\r\nroyal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or\r\nalter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws\r\nwithout his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without\r\ntheirs. He assur\'d me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so,\r\nhowever, and his lordship\'s conversation having a little alarm\'d me as\r\nto what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it\r\ndown as soon as I return\'d to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20\r\nyears before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the\r\nministry had propos\'d to make the king\'s instructions laws in the\r\ncolonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for which we\r\nadored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by their\r\nconduct towards us in 1765 it seem\'d that they had refus\'d that point\r\nof sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n    [118] George Granville or Grenville (1712-1770). As\r\n    English premier from 1763 to 1765, he introduced the\r\n    direct taxation of the American Colonies and has\r\n    sometimes been called the immediate cause of the\r\n    Revolution.\r\n\r\n    [119] This whole passage shows how hopelessly divergent\r\n    were the English and American views on the relations\r\n    between the mother country and her colonies. Grenville\r\n    here made clear that the Americans were to have no voice\r\n    in making or amending their laws. Parliament and the\r\n    king were to have absolute power over the colonies. No\r\n    wonder Franklin was alarmed by this new doctrine. With\r\n    his keen insight into human nature and his consequent\r\n    knowledge of American character, he foresaw the\r\n    inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of\r\n    England. This conversation with Grenville makes these\r\n    last pages of the _Autobiography_ one of its most\r\n    important parts.\r\n\r\nAfter some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries,\r\nthey agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn\'s house in Spring\r\nGarden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of\r\ndisposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had\r\nits own ideas of what should be meant by _reasonable_. We then went\r\ninto consideration of our several points of complaint, which I\r\nenumerated. The proprietaries justify\'d their conduct as well as they\r\ncould, and I the Assembly\'s. We now appeared very wide, and so far\r\nfrom each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of\r\nagreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the heads\r\nof our complaints in writing, and they promis\'d then to consider them.\r\nI did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their\r\nsolicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law\r\nbusiness in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of\r\nMaryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for\r\nthem all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly.\r\nHe was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answers of\r\nthe Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they being really\r\nweak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a\r\nmortal enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I\r\ndeclin\'d the proprietary\'s proposal that he and I should discuss the\r\nheads of complaint between our two selves, and refus\'d treating with\r\nanyone but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the hands\r\nof the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel\r\nupon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, during\r\nwhich time I made frequent demands of an answer from the\r\nproprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had not\r\nyet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What\r\nit was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not\r\ncommunicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn\r\nand signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of\r\nformality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification\r\nof their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate\r\nmatters if the Assembly would send out _some person of candour_ to\r\ntreat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other\r\nin our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement"]\r\n\r\nThe want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having\r\naddress\'d the paper to them with their assum\'d titles of True and\r\nAbsolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which I\r\nomitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of\r\nwhich was only to reduce to a certainty by writing, what in\r\nconversation I had delivered _viva voce_.\r\n\r\nBut during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov\'r Denny\r\nto pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the\r\nestates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute, they\r\nomitted answering the message.\r\n\r\nWhen this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by\r\nParis, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent.\r\nAccordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a hearing was\r\nappointed in which two lawyers were employ\'d by them against the act,\r\nand two by me in support of it. They alledg\'d that the act was\r\nintended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the\r\npeople, and that if it were suffer\'d to continue in force, and the\r\nproprietaries, who were in odium with the people, left to their mercy\r\nin proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined. We\r\nreply\'d that the act had no such intention, and would have no such\r\neffect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath\r\nto assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of them\r\nmight expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the\r\nproprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.\r\nThis is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides, except\r\nthat we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must\r\nattend a repeal, for that the money, \xc2\xa3100,000, being printed and given\r\nto the king\'s use, expended in his service, and now spread among the\r\npeople, the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of\r\nmany, and the total discouragement of future grants, and the\r\nselfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general\r\ncatastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed\r\ntoo highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, Lord\r\nMansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning me took me into the\r\nclerk\'s chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I\r\nwas really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary\r\nestate in the execution of the act. I said certainly. "Then," says he,\r\n"you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure\r\nthat point." I answer\'d, "None at all." He then call\'d in Paris, and\r\nafter some discourse, his lordship\'s proposition was accepted on both\r\nsides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the\r\nCouncil, which I sign\'d with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the\r\nProvince for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to\r\nthe Council Chamber, where finally the law was allowed to pass. Some\r\nchanges were however recommended and we also engaged they should be\r\nmade by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them\r\nnecessary; for one year\'s tax having been levied by the act before the\r\norder of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to examine the\r\nproceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put several\r\nparticular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, they\r\nunanimously sign\'d a report that they found the tax had been assess\'d\r\nwith perfect equity.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the\r\nengagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it secured\r\nthe credit of the paper money then spread over all the country. They\r\ngave me their thanks in form when I return\'d. But the proprietaries\r\nwere enraged at Governor Denny for having pass\'d the act, and turn\'d\r\nhim out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he\r\nhad given bond to observe. He, however, having done it at the instance\r\nof the General, and for His Majesty\'s service, and having some\r\npowerful interest at court, despis\'d the threats and they were never\r\nput in execution....

To the top of the upright\r\nstick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a\r\nfoot or more above the wood. To the end of the twine, next the hand,\r\nis to be tied a silk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join, a key\r\nmay be fastened. This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears\r\nto be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand within\r\na door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not\r\nbe wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame\r\nof the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder clouds come over\r\nthe kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and\r\nthe kite, with all the twine will be electrified, and the loose\r\nfilaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an\r\napproaching finger. And when the rain has wet the kite and twine, so\r\nthat it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it stream\r\nout plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At this\r\nkey the phial may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained,\r\nspirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed,\r\nwhich are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube,\r\nand thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning\r\ncompletely demonstrated.\r\n\r\nB.

But\r\n_Idleness_ taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent\r\nin absolute _Sloth_, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in\r\nidle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. _Sloth_, by\r\nbringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. _Sloth, like Rust,\r\nconsumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright,\r\nas Poor Richard says.

How\r\nmuch more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that _The\r\nsleeping Fox catches no Poultry_, and that _There will be sleeping\r\nenough in the Grave_, as _Poor Richard_ says.\r\n\r\n_If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as\r\nPoor Richard_ says, _the_ _greatest Prodigality_; since, as he\r\nelsewhere tells us, _Lost Time is never found again; and what we call\r\nTime enough, always proves little enough_: Let us then up and be\r\ndoing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with\r\nless Perplexity. _Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry all\r\neasy_, as _Poor Richard_ says; and _He that riseth late must trot all\r\nDay, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness\r\ntravels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him_, as we read in\r\n_Poor Richard_, who adds, _Drive thy Business, let not that drive\r\nthee_; and _Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy,\r\nwealthy, and wise._\r\n\r\n_Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die\r\nfasting._\r\n\r\n_There are no Gains without Pains._\r\n\r\n_He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath\r\nan Office of Profit and Honor_; but then the _Trade_ must be worked\r\nat, and the _Calling_ well followed, or neither the _Estate_ nor the\r\n_Office_ will enable us to pay our Taxes.\r\n\r\nWhat though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left\r\nyou a Legacy, _Diligence is the Mother of Good-luck_, as _Poor\r\nRichard_ says, _and God gives all Things to Industry_.\r\n\r\n_One To-day is worth two To-morrows_, and farther, _Have you somewhat\r\nto do To-morrow, do it To-day_.\r\n\r\nIf you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master\r\nshould catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, _be ashamed to\r\ncatch yourself idle_.\r\n\r\nStick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for _Constant\r\nDropping wears away Stones_, and by _Diligence and Patience the Mouse\r\nate in two the Cable_; and _Little Strokes fell great Oaks_.\r\n\r\nMethinks I hear some of you say, _Must a Man afford himself no\r\nLeisure_? I will tell thee, my friend, what _Poor Richard_ says,\r\n_Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, since\r\nthou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour_. Leisure, is\r\nTime for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will\r\nobtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as _Poor Richard_ says, _A\r\nLife of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things_.\r\n\r\n_Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee_; and again, _If you would\r\nhave your business done, go; if not, send._\r\n\r\nIf you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n_A little Neglect may breed great Mischief:_ adding, _for want of a\r\nNail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for\r\nwant of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the\r\nEnemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail_.\r\n\r\nSo much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one\'s own Business;\r\nbut to these we must add _Frugality_.\r\n\r\n_What maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children_. You may think\r\nperhaps, that a _little_ Tea, or a _little_ Punch now and then, Diet a\r\n_little_ more costly, Clothes a _little_ finer, and a _little_\r\nEntertainment now and then, can be no _great_ Matter; but remember\r\nwhat _Poor Richard_ says, _Many a Little makes a Mickle._\r\n\r\n_Beware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship_; and\r\nagain, _Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove_; and moreover, _Fools\r\nmake Feasts, and wise Men eat them._\r\n\r\nBuy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy\r\nNecessaries.\r\n\r\nIf you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for,\r\nhe that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.\r\n\r\nThe second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt.\r\n\r\n_Lying rides upon Debt\'s Back_.\r\n\r\nPoverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: \'_Tis hard for\r\nan empty Bag to stand upright_.\r\n\r\nAnd now to conclude, _Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will\r\nlearn in no other, and scarce in that_; for it is true, _we may give\r\nAdvice, but we cannot give Conduct_, as _Poor Richard_ says: However,\r\nremember this, _They that won\'t be counseled, can\'t be helped_, as\r\n_Poor Richard_ says: and farther, That _if you will not hear Reason,\r\nshe\'ll surely rap your Knuckles_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHISTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Madame Brillon\r\n\r\nPassy, November 10, 1779.\r\n\r\nI am charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan of\r\nliving there; and I approve much of your conclusion, that, in the\r\nmeantime, we should draw all the good we can from this world. In my\r\nopinion, we might all draw more good from it than we do, and suffer\r\nless evil, if we would take care not to give too much for whistles.\r\nFor to me it seems, that most of the unhappy people we meet with, are\r\nbecome so by neglect of that caution.\r\n\r\nYou ask what I mean? You love stories, and will excuse my telling one\r\nof myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child of seven year old, my friends, on a holiday, filled\r\nmy pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys\r\nfor children; and being charmed with the sound of a _whistle_, that I\r\nmet by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and\r\ngave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all\r\nover the house, much pleased with my _whistle_, but disturbing all the\r\nfamily. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the\r\nbargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as\r\nit was worth; put me in mind what good things I might have bought with\r\nthe rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I\r\ncried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the\r\n_whistle_ gave me pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing\r\non my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary\r\nthing, I said to myself, _Don\'t give too much for the whistle_; and I\r\nsaved my money.\r\n\r\nAs I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I\r\nthought I met with many, very many, who _gave too much for the\r\nwhistle_.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in\r\nattendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps\r\nhis friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, _This man gives too\r\nmuch for his whistle_.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in\r\npolitical bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by\r\nneglect, _He pays, indeed_, said I, _too much for his whistle_.\r\n\r\nIf I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all\r\nthe pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow\r\ncitizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of\r\naccumulating wealth, _Poor man_, said I, _you pay too much for your\r\nwhistle_.\r\n\r\nWhen I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable\r\nimprovement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal\r\nsensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, _Mistaken man_,\r\nsaid I, _you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you\r\ngive too much for your whistle_.\r\n\r\nIf I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine\r\nfurniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he\r\ncontracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, _Alas_! say I, _he\r\nhas paid dear, very dear, for his whistle_.\r\n\r\nWhen I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured\r\nbrute of a husband, _What a pity_, say I, _that she should pay so much\r\nfor a whistle_!\r\n\r\nIn short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are\r\nbrought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value\r\nof things, and by their _giving too much for their whistles_.\r\n\r\nYet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider,\r\nthat, with all this wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain\r\nthings in the world so tempting, for example, the apples of King John,\r\nwhich happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to sale by\r\nauction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase,\r\nand find that I had once more given too much for the _whistle_.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely and\r\nwith unalterable affection,\r\n\r\nB. Franklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER\r\n\r\nPassy, May 12, 1784.\r\n\r\nRevd Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is now more than 60 years since I left Boston, but I remember well\r\nboth your father and grandfather, having heard them both in the\r\npulpit, and seen them in their houses. The last time I saw your father\r\nwas in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first trip\r\nto Pennsylvania. He received me in his library, and on my taking leave\r\nshowed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage,\r\nwhich was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking as I\r\nwithdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him,\r\nwhen he said hastily, "_Stoop, stoop!_" I did not understand him, till\r\nI felt my head hit against the beam. He was a man that never missed\r\nany occasion of giving instruction, and upon this he said to me, "_You\r\nare young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it,\r\nand you will miss many hard thumps_." This advice, thus beat into my\r\nhead, has frequently been of use to me; and I often think of it, when\r\nI see pride mortified, and misfortunes brought upon people by their\r\ncarrying their heads too high.\r\n\r\nB. Franklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last and most complete edition of Franklin\'s works is that by the\r\nlate Professor Albert H. Smyth, published in ten volumes by the\r\nMacmillan Company, New York, under the title, _The Writings of\r\nBenjamin Franklin_. The other standard edition is the _Works of\r\nBenjamin Franklin_ by John Bigelow (New York, 1887). Mr. Bigelow\'s\r\nfirst edition of the _Autobiography_ in one volume was published by\r\nthe J. B. Lippincott Company of Philadelphia in 1868. The life of\r\nFranklin as a writer is well treated by J. B. McMaster in a volume of\r\n_The American Men of Letters Series_; his life as a statesman and\r\ndiplomat, by J. T. Morse, _American Statesmen Series_, one volume;\r\nHoughton, Mifflin Company publish both books. A more exhaustive\r\naccount of the life and times of Franklin may be found in James\r\nParton\'s _Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin_ (2 vols., New York,\r\n1864). Paul Leicester Ford\'s _The Many-Sided Franklin_ is a most\r\nchatty and readable book, replete with anecdotes and excellently and\r\nfully illustrated. An excellent criticism by Woodrow Wilson introduces\r\nan edition of the _Autobiography_ in _The Century Classics_ (Century\r\nCo., New York, 1901). Interesting magazine articles are those of E. E.\r\nHale, _Christian Examiner_, lxxi, 447; W. P. Trent, _McClure\'s\r\nMagazine_, viii, 273; John Hay, _The Century Magazine_, lxxi, 447.\r\n\r\nSee also the histories of American literature by C. F. Richardson,\r\nMoses Coit Tyler, Brander Matthews, John Nichol, and Barrett Wendell,\r\nas well as the various encyclopedias. An excellent bibliography of\r\nFranklin is that of Paul Leicester Ford, entitled _A List of Books\r\nWritten by, or Relating to Benjamin Franklin_ (New York, 1889).\r\n\r\nThe following list of Franklin\'s works contains the more interesting\r\npublications, together with the dates of first issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1722.

XL.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nPennsylvania _GAZETTE_.\r\nContaining the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestick.\r\n\r\nFrom Thursday, September 25. to Thursday, October 2. 1729.\r\n\r\n_The_ Pennsylvania Gazette _being now to\r\nbe carry\'d on by other Hands, the Reader\r\nmay expect some Account of the Method we\r\ndesign to proceed in._\r\n\r\n_Upon a View of Chambers\'s great Dictionaries,\r\nfrom whence were taken the Materials of the_\r\nUniversal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences,\r\n_which usually made the First Part of this Paper,\r\nwe find that besides their containing many Things\r\nabstruse or insignificant to us, it will probably\r\nbe fifty Years before the Whole can be gone thro\'\r\nin this Manner of Publication. There are likewise\r\nin those Books continual References from\r\nThings under one Letter of the Alphabet to those\r\nunder another, which relate to the same Subject,\r\nand are necessary to explain and compleat it;\r\nthose are taken in their Turn may perhaps be Ten\r\nYears distant; and since it is likely that they who\r\ndesire to acquaint themselves with any particular\r\nArt or Science, would gladly have the whole before\r\nthem in a much less Time, we believe our\r\nReaders will not think such a Method of communicating\r\nKnowledge to be a proper One._\r\n\r\n_However, tho\' we do not intend to continue the\r\nPublication of those Dictionaries in a regular\r\nAlphabetical Method, as has hitherto been done;\r\nyet as several Things exhibited from them in the\r\nCourse of these Papers, have been entertaining\r\nto such of the Curious, who never had and cannot\r\nhave the Advantage of good Libraries; and\r\nas there are many Things still behind, which being\r\nin this Manner made generally known, may\r\nperhaps become of considerable Use, by giving such\r\nHints to the excellent natural Genius\'s of our\r\nCountry, as may contribute either to the Improvement\r\nof our present Manufactures, or towards\r\nthe Invention of new Ones; we propose\r\nfrom Time to Time to communicate such particular\r\nParts as appear to be of the most general\r\nConsequence._\r\n\r\n_As to the_ Religious Courtship, _Part of\r\nwhich has been retal\'d to the Publick in these\r\nPapers, the Reader may be inform\'d, that the\r\nwhole Book will probably in a little Time be\r\nprinted and bound up by it-self; and those who\r\napprove of it, will doubtless be better pleas\'d to\r\nhave it entire, than in this broken interrupted\r\nManner._\r\n\r\n_There are many who have long desired to see a\r\ngood News-Paper in_ Pennsylvania; _and we hope\r\nthose Gentlemen who are able, will contribute towards\r\nthe making This such. We ask Assistance,\r\nbecause we are fully sensible, that to publish a\r\ngood New-Paper is not so easy an Undertaking\r\nas many People imagine it to be. The Author of\r\na Gazette (in the Opinion of the Learned) ought\r\nto be qualified with an extensive Acquaintance\r\nwith Languages, a great Easiness and Command\r\nof Writing and Relating Things cleanly and intelligibly,\r\nand in few Words; he should be able\r\nto speak of War both by Land and Sea; be well\r\nacquainted with Geography, with the History of\r\nthe Time, with the several Interests of Princes\r\nand States, the Secrets of Courts, and the Manners\r\nand Customs of all Nations. Men thus accomplish\'d\r\nare very rare in this remote Part of\r\nthe World; and it would be well if the Writer\r\nof these Papers could make up among his Friends\r\nwhat is wanting in himself._\r\n\r\n_Upon the Whole, we may assure the Publick,\r\nthat as far as the Encouragement we meet with\r\nwill enable us, no Care and Pains shall be omitted,\r\nthat may make the_ Pennsylvania Gazette\r\n_as agreeable and useful an Entertainment as the\r\nNature of the Thing will allow._\r\n\r\nThe Following is the last Message sent by\r\nhis Excellency Governor _Burnet_, to the\r\nHouse of Representatives in _Boston_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,_\r\n\r\nIt is not with so vain a Hope as to convince you, that\r\nI take the Trouble to answer your Messages, but, if\r\npossible, to open the Eyes of the deluded People whom\r\nyou represent, and whom you are at so much Pains to keep\r\nin Ignorance of the true State of their Affairs. I need not\r\ngo further for an undeniable Proof of this Endeavour to\r\nblind them, than your ordering the Letter of Messieurs\r\n_Wilks_ and _Belcher_ of the 7th of _June_ last to your Speaker to\r\nbe published.

A Jingle.\r\n\r\nA Swarm of Sparks, young, gay, and bold,\r\nLov\'d _Sylvia_ long, but she was cold;\r\nIn\'trest and Pride the Nymph control\'d,\r\nSo they in vain their Passion told.\r\nAt last came Dalman, he was old;\r\nNay, he was ugly, but had Gold.\r\nHe came, and saw, and took the Hold,\r\nWhile t\'other Beaux their Loss Condol\'d.\r\nSome say, she\'s Wed; I say, she\'s sold.\r\n\r\n_The Letter against Inoculating the Small Pox, (Sign\'d\r\nAbsinthium) giving an Account of the Number of\r\nPersons who have dy\'d under that Operation, will be\r\nInserted in our next._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n_Ispahan, March 6._ The Conspiracy form\'d by the\r\nGrand Vizir last January was Twelvemonth, with design\r\nto make himself King of Persia, was seasonably\r\ndiscover\'d, and himself and Accomplices secured; since\r\nwhich the State hath enjoy\'d its former Tranquility,\r\nand a new Vizir is appointed in his room, The old\r\none\'s Eyes being both put out, he is kept alive (but\r\nin Prison) to make him discover all his Riches;\r\nwhich must be immensely great, since they found in\r\none of his Chests four hundred thousand Persian Ducats,\r\nbeside Foreign Coin, and in another Place abundance\r\nof Jewels, Gold and Silver; and so in proportion\r\namong several of his Accomplices; by the help of\r\nwhich Treasure they hoped to compass their Ends.\r\n\r\n_Tripoli, July 12._ As soon as our Squadron fitted out\r\nagainst the Famous Baffaw Gianur, Cogia, appear\'d off\r\nDasna and Bengan, with two thousand five hundred\r\nMoorish Horse, and a thousand Foot, and skirmish\'d\r\na little with his Squadron, he abandon\'d both those\r\nPlaces, and fled to the Island of Serby in the Territories\r\nof Tunis; But the Bey of that Place having deny\'d\r\nhim Shelter, he sail\'d farther away, in a French\r\nBarque, we know not whether; and his own Galleys\r\nand Barques, are gone after him, so that we are now\r\nentirely rid of that troublesome Guest. Our Rovers\r\nkeep all in Port, for Fear of the Malteze.\r\n\r\n_Cadiz, Aug. 12._ The Flota is expected Home from\r\nthe West-Indies before the End of this Month.\r\nThirteen Pieces of Cannon and two Mortars were lately\r\nsent from hence to Ceuta. The three Spanish Men\r\nof War of 50 to 60 Guns each, which carried the Spanish\r\nCardinals to Italy, are now at Alicant: It is said\r\nthey are to join the Dutch Vice-Admiral, who is now\r\nin this Bay with four Ships of his Squadron of 50\r\nGuns each, and cruize against the Algerines. Wheat\r\nand Barley being very cheap in these Parts, great\r\nQuantities have been sent lately to the Canaries,\r\nwhere for some Time past the Inhabitants have been\r\nin great Want of Corn. On the 9th Instant died Mr.\r\nCharles, His Britannick Majesty\'s Consul at St.\r\nLucas.\r\n\r\n_Berne, Aug. 20._ The Deputies of this Canton who\r\nwent to the Diet at Frawenfeldt, are now assembled\r\nat Baden with those of Zurich and Glaris, to regulate\r\ncertain Affairs relating to the Town and County of\r\nBaden, which formerly belonged to the Eight Eldest\r\nCantons, but in the last Swiss War was given up to\r\nZurich and Berne in Propriety, with a Reservation to\r\nthe Canton of Glaris (which is mostly Protestant) of\r\nthe Share it had before in the Sovereignty of that\r\nDistrict. The three Deputies of Zurich, Lucern &c\r\nUry, who were commissioned by the late General Dyet\r\nto go to Wilchingen, to try to compose the Differences\r\nwhich have been long standing between the Inhabitants\r\nof that Place and the Canton of Schafhuysen\r\nwhose Subjects they are, have offered those Inhabitonts\r\na full Pardon for all past Misbehavior, and\r\nthe Maintenance of their Privileges for the future,\r\nprovided they forthwith return to their Duty; but\r\nit is advised that those of Wilchingen persist hitherto\r\nin this Disobedience.\r\n\r\n_Schaffhausen Sept. 1._ They write from Italy, that\r\nthe Plague is no longer observ\'d at Marseilles, Aix, &\r\nseveral other Places; and that at Toulon it is very\r\nmuch decreas\'d: But alas! how should it be otherwise,\r\nwhen the Distemper hath hardly any Objects\r\nleft to work upon? At Arles it is likewise abated,\r\nwe fear for the same Reason. Mean while, it spreads\r\nin the Gevaudan; and two large Villages in the\r\nNeighbourhood of Frejus were attack\'d the beginning\r\nof this Month. The French Court hath prohibited\r\nall communication with the Gevaudan upon severe\r\nPenalties. The Plague is certainly got into the\r\nsmall Town of  Marvegue in that District, which\r\nTown is shut in by eight hundred Men. Letters from\r\nGeneva say, the two Battalions employ\'d in surrounding\r\nLa Canourgue, are infected; and that Maages is\r\nvery much suspected. The Marquis de Quelus had\r\nretired to a Castle near Avignon; but the Sickness\r\nbeing got among his Domesticks, he was fled farther\r\naway.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Sept. 5._ The District over which the Duke\r\nof Berwick is to have the Command, extends to the\r\nBorders of the Bourbonnois; and the Court puts a\r\ngreat Confidence in the Care of that General to hinder\r\nthe Infection from spreading. The Marquis de\r\nVerceil is actually drawing Lines to shut in the Gevaudan;\r\nand twelve Regiments of Foot, and as many\r\nof Dragoons, are marching to reinforce the Troops\r\nalready posted on that side. The Plague seems to\r\nhave almost spent itself in Provence. Tho\' it is yet\r\na great way off of us, Men talk nevertheless of laying\r\nup Magazines of all sort of Provisions here, and of making\r\ntwenty thousand Beds, to be set up in the Hospitals\r\nand Tennis-Courts.\r\n\r\n_Hague, Sept. 9._ The Deputies of our Admiralties\r\nhad, last Saturday, an extraordinary Conference with\r\nthose of the States General, upon the spreading of a\r\nReport, that ten or twelve Persons died daily at a certain\r\nPlace in Normandy, which was therefore suspected\r\nto have received the Contagion; But upon the\r\nmatter, it doth not appear there was the least Foundation\r\nfor such a Report; tho\' it is too plain the\r\nDistemper gains ground space in the Southern Parts\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nWe can by no means penetrate into the Designs of\r\nthe Czar; who, notwithstanding \'tis confidently\r\nwritten that the Peace between him and Sweden is as\r\ngood as concluded, hath a Fleet of thirty Men of War\r\nand two hundred Galleys at Sea near Aland. However,\r\nan Express gone by from Stockholm, doth not\r\nconfirm.\r\n\r\n[End of trancriptions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, by \r\nBenjamin Franklin\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 20203-8.txt or 20203-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/2/0/20203/\r\n\r\nProduced by Turgut Dincer, Brian Sogard and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
