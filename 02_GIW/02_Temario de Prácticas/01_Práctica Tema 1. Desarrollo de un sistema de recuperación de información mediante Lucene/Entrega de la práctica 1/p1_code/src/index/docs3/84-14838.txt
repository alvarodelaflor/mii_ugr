I am going out.\'\r\n\r\nThen old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through\r\nthe wood to the baker\'s. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five\r\ncurrant buns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFlopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went\r\ndown the lane to gather blackberries:\r\n\r\nBut Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor\'s\r\ngarden, and squeezed under the gate!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate\r\nsome radishes;\r\n\r\nAnd then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.\r\nMcGregor!\r\n\r\nMr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,\r\nbut he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out,\r\n\'Stop thief!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPeter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,\r\nfor he had forgotten the way back to the gate.\r\n\r\nHe lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe\r\namongst the potatoes.\r\n\r\nAfter losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I\r\nthink he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately\r\nrun into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his\r\njacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPeter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were\r\noverheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great\r\nexcitement, and implored him to exert himself.\r\n\r\nMr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the\r\ntop of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have\r\nbeen a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.\r\n\r\nMr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the\r\ntool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn\r\nthem over carefully, looking under each.\r\n\r\nPresently Peter sneezed--\'Kertyschoo!\' Mr. McGregor was after him in\r\nno time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,\r\nupsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and\r\nhe was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.\r\n\r\nPeter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with\r\nfright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was\r\nvery damp with sitting in that can.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not\r\nvery fast, and looking all round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room\r\nfor a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.\r\n\r\nAn old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying\r\npeas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to\r\nthe gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not\r\nanswer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.\r\n\r\nThen he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he\r\nbecame more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr.\r\nMcGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some\r\ngold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her\r\ntail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away\r\nwithout speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin,\r\nlittle Benjamin Bunny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him,\r\nhe heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.\r\nPeter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing\r\nhappened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over.\r\nThe first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was\r\nturned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!\r\n\r\nPeter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running\r\nas fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some\r\nblack-currant bushes.\r\n\r\nMr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not\r\ncare. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood\r\noutside the garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow\r\nto frighten the blackbirds.\r\n\r\nPeter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to\r\nthe big fir-tree.\r\n\r\nHe was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the\r\nfloor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy\r\ncooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the\r\nsecond little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a\r\nfortnight!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.\r\n\r\nHis mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a\r\ndose of it to Peter!\r\n\r\n\'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and\r\nblackberries for supper.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Tale of Peter Rabbit, by Beatrix Potter\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 14838.txt or 14838.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/8/3/14838/\r\n\r\nProduced by Robert Cicconetti, Ronald Holder and the PG Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net).\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
