THE PRESENT TEXT.\r\n\r\nThe text of the \'Canterbury Tales,\' as printed in the present volume, is an\r\nentirely new one, owing nothing to the numerous printed editions which have\r\npreceded it. The only exceptions to this statement are to be found in the\r\ncase of such portions as have been formerly edited, for the Clarendon\r\nPress, by Dr. Morris and myself. The reasons for the necessity of a\r\nformation of an absolutely new text will appear on a perusal of the text\r\nitself, as compared with any of its predecessors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it owes everything to the labours of Dr. Furnivall for\r\nthe Chaucer Society, but for which no satisfactory results could have been\r\nobtained, except at the cost of more time and toil than I could well devote\r\nto the subject. In other words, my work is entirely founded upon the\r\nsplendid \'Six-text\' Edition published by that Society, supplemented by the\r\nvery valuable reprint of the celebrated \'Harleian\' manuscript in the same\r\nseries. These Seven Texts are all exact reproductions of seven important\r\nMSS., and are, in two respects, more important to the student than the MSS.\r\nthemselves; that is to say, they can be studied simultaneously instead of\r\nseparately, and they can be consulted and re-consulted at any moment, being\r\nalways accessible. The importance of such opportunities is obvious.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 2. THE MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\nThe following list contains all the MSS. of the existence of which I am\r\naware. As to their types, see \xc2\xa7 7. [viii]\r\n\r\nI. MSS. IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n1. Harl. 7334; denoted here by HL. By Tyrwhitt called \'C.\' A MS of the\r\nB-type (see below). Printed in full for the Chaucer Society, 1885. Collated\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n    A MS. of great importance, but difficult to understand or describe. For\r\n    the greater clearness, I shall roughly describe the MSS. as being of\r\n    the A-type, the B-type, the C-type, and the D-type (really a second\r\n    C-type). Of the A-type, the best example is the Ellesmere MS.; of the\r\n    B-type, the best example is the Harleian MS. 7334; of the C-type, the\r\n    Corpus and Lansdowne MSS.; the D-type is that exhibited by Caxton and\r\n    Thynne in the early printed editions. They may be called the\r\n    \'Ellesmere,\' \'Harleian,\' \'Corpus,\' and \'Caxton\' types respectively.\r\n    These types differ as to the arrangement of the Tales, and even MSS. of\r\n    a similar type differ slightly, in this respect, among themselves. They\r\n    also frequently differ as to certain characteristic readings, although\r\n    many of the variations of reading are peculiar to one or two MSS. only.\r\n\r\n    MS. Hl. contains the best copy of the Tale of Gamelyn, for which see p.\r\n    645; this Tale is not found in MSS. of the A-type. Moreover, Group G\r\n    here precedes Group C and a large part of Group B, whereas in the\r\n    Ellesmere MS. it follows them. In the Monk\'s Tale, the lines numbered B\r\n    3565-3652 (containing the Tales called the \'modern instances\')\r\n    immediately follow B 3564 (as in this edition), whereas in the\r\n    Ellesmere MS. these lines come at the end of the Tale.\r\n\r\n    The \'various readings\' of this MS. are often peculiar, and it is\r\n    difficult to appraise them. I take them to be of two kinds: (i)\r\n    readings which are better than those of the Six-text, and should\r\n    certainly be preferred, such as _halfe_ in A 8, _cloysterlees_ in A\r\n    179, _a_ (not _a ful_) in A 196, and the like; and (2) readings due to\r\n    a terrible blundering on the part of the scribe, such as _fleyng_ for\r\n    _flikeringe_ in A 1962, _greene_ for _kene_ in A 1966, and the like. It\r\n    is, in fact, a most dangerous MS. to trust to, unless constantly\r\n    corrected by others, and is not at all fitted to be taken as the\r\n    _basis_ of a text. For further remarks, see the description of Wright\'s\r\n    printed edition at p. xvi.\r\n\r\n    As regards age, this MS. is one of the oldest; and it is beautifully\r\n    written. Its chief defect is the loss of eight leaves, so that ll.\r\n    617-1223 in Group F are missing. It also misses several lines in\r\n    various places; as A 2013-8, 2958, 3721-2, 4355, 4358, 4375-6, 4415-22;\r\n    B 417, 1186-90, 1355, 1376-9, 1995, 3213-20, 4136-7, 4479-80; C 299,\r\n    300, 305-6, 478-9; D 575-584, 605-612, 619-626, 717-720; E 2356-7; F\r\n    1455-6, 1493-8; G 155, 210-216; besides some lines in Melibee and the\r\n    Persones Tale. Moreover, it has nine spurious lines, D 2004 _b_, _c_,\r\n    2012 _b_, _c_, 2037 _b_, _c_ 2048 _b_, _c_, F 592. These imperfections\r\n    furnish an additional reason for not founding a text upon this MS.\r\n\r\n2. Harl. 7335; by Tyrwhitt called \'A.\' Of the B-type. Very imperfect,\r\nespecially at the end. A few lines are printed in the Six-text edition to\r\nfill up gaps in various MSS., viz. E 1646-7, F 1-8, 1423-4, 1433-4, G 158,\r\n213-4, 326-337, 432-3, 484. Collated so far.\r\n\r\n[ix] 3. Harl. 7333; by Tyrwhitt called \'E.\' Of the D-type. One of Shirley\'s\r\nMSS. Some lines are printed in the Six-text edition, viz. B 4233-8, E\r\n1213-44, F 1147-8, 1567-8, G 156-9, 213-4, 326-337, 432. It also contains\r\nsome of the Minor Poems; see the description of MS. \'Harl.\' in the\r\nIntroduction to those poems in vol. i.[1]\r\n\r\n4. Harl. 1758, denoted by HARL. at p. 645; by Tyrwhitt called \'F.\' In\r\nUrry\'s list, i. Of the D-type, but containing Gamelyn. Many lines are\r\nprinted in the Six-text, including the whole of \'Gamelyn.\' It is freely\r\nused to fill up gaps, as B 1-9, 2096-2108, 3049-78, 4112, 4114, 4581-4636,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n5. Harl. 1239; in Tyrwhitt, \'I.\' In Urry\'s list, ii. Imperfect both at\r\nbeginning and end.\r\n\r\n6. Royal 18 C II; denoted by RL.; in Tyrwhitt, \'B.\' In Urry, vii. Of the\r\nD-type, but containing Gamelyn. Used to fill up gaps in the Six-text; e.g.\r\nin B 1163-1190 (Shipman\'s Prologue, called in this MS. the Squire\'s\r\nPrologue), 2109-73, 3961-80, E 65, 73, 81, 143, G 1337-40, I 472-511. The\r\nwhole of \'Gamelyn\' is also printed from this MS. in the Six-text.\r\n\r\n7. Royal 17 D xv; in Tyrwhitt, \'D.\' In Urry, viii. Of the D-type, but\r\ncontaining Gamelyn. Used to fill up gaps in the Six-text; e.g. in B\r\n2328-61, 3961-80, 4112, 4114, 4233-8, 4637-51, D 609-612, 619-626, 717-720,\r\nE 1213-44, F 1423-4, 1433-4, H 47-52; and in the Tale of Gamelyn.\r\n\r\n8. Sloane 1685; denoted by SL. In Tyrwhitt, \'G.\' In Urry, iii. Of the\r\nD-type, but containing Gamelyn. In two handwritings, one later than the\r\nother. Imperfect; has no Sir Thopas, Melibee, Manciple, or Parson. Very\r\nfrequently quoted in the Six-text, to fill up rather large gaps in the\r\nCambridge MS.; e.g. A 754-964, 3829-90, 4365-4422, &c. Gamelyn is printed\r\nfrom this MS. in the Six-text, the gaps in it being filled up from MS. 7\r\n(above).\r\n\r\n9. Sloane 1686; in Tyrwhitt, \'H.\' In Urry, iv. Of the C-type; containing\r\nGamelyn. A late MS., on paper. Imperfect; no Canon\'s Yeoman or Parson.\r\n\r\n10. Lansdowne 851; denoted by LN. In Tyrwhitt, \'W,\' because at that time in\r\nthe possession of P. C. Webb, Esq. Used by Mr. Wright to fill up the large\r\ngap in Hl., viz. F 617-1223, and frequently consulted by him and others.\r\nPrinted in full as [x] the sixth MS. of the Six-text. Of the C-type;\r\ncontaining Gamelyn. Not a good MS., being certainly the worst of the six;\r\nbut worth printing owing to the frequent use that has been made of it by\r\neditors.\r\n\r\n11. Additional 5140; in Tyrwhitt, \'Ask. _2_,\' as being one of two MSS. lent\r\nto him by Dr. Askew. It has in it the arms of H. Deane, Archbp. of\r\nCanterbury, 1501-3. Of the A-type. Quoted in the Six-text to fill up gaps;\r\ne.g. B 3961-80, 4233-8, 4637-52, D 2158-2294, E 1213-44, 1646-7, 2419-40, F\r\n1-8, 673-708, G 103, I 887-944, 1044-92.\r\n\r\n12. Additional 25718. A mere fragment. A short passage from it, C 409-427,\r\nis quoted in the Six-text, to fill up a gap in Ln.\r\n\r\n13. Egerton 2726; called the \'Haistwell MS.\'; in Tyrwhitt denoted by \'HA,\'\r\nand formerly belonging to E. Haistwell, Esq. Of the A-type, but imperfect.\r\nThe Six-text quotes F 679, 680: also F 673-708 in the Preface.\r\n\r\nII. MSS. IN OXFORD.\r\n\r\n14. Bodley 686; no. 2527 in Bernard\'s list; in Tyrwhitt, \'B [alpha].\' A\r\nneat MS., with illuminations. Of the A-type; imperfect. The latter part of\r\nthe Cook\'s Tale is on an inserted leaf (leaf 55), and concludes the Tale in\r\na manner that is not Chaucer\'s. After the Canterbury Tales occur several\r\npoems by Lydgate.\r\n\r\n15. Bodley 414; not noticed by Tyrwhitt. Given to the library by B. Heath\r\nin 1766. A late MS. of the D-type, and imperfect. No Cook, Gamelyn, Squire,\r\nor Merchant.\r\n\r\n16. Laud 739: no. 1234 in Bernard\'s list; in Tyrwhitt, \'B [beta].\' A poor\r\nand late MS. of the D-type, but containing Gamelyn; imperfect at the end;\r\nends with Sir Thopas, down to B 2056.\r\n\r\n17. Laud 600; no. 1476 in Bernard\'s list; in Tyrwhitt, \'B [gamma].\'\r\nImperfect; several leaves \'restored.\' Apparently, of the B-type; but Group\r\nD and the Clerk\'s Tale follow Gamelyn. Some extracts from it are given in\r\nthe Six-text, viz. B 2328-61, D 717-20 (no other Oxford MS. has these\r\nscarce lines), F 673-708.\r\n\r\n18. Arch. Selden B 14; no. 3360 in Bernard\'s list; in Tyrwhitt, \'B\r\n[delta].\' Perhaps the best and earliest of the Bodleian MSS., but not very\r\ngood. Sometimes here quoted as SELD. Apparently of the A-type, having no\r\ncopy of Gamelyn; but it practically [xi] represents a transition-state\r\nbetween the A and B types, and has one correction of prime importance, as\r\nit is the only MS. which links together all the Tales in Group B, making\r\nthe Shipman follow the Man of Law. Frequent extracts from it occur in the\r\nSix-text; e.g. A 1-72, B 1163-1190, &c. In particular, a large portion of\r\nthe Parson\'s Tale, I 290-1086, is printed from this MS. in the same.\r\n\r\n19. Barlow 20; no. 6420 in Bernard\'s list; in Tyrwhitt, \'B [zeta]\' A\r\nclearly written MS. of the D-type, including Gamelyn; imperfect after Sir\r\nThopas, but contains a portion of the Manciple\'s Tale. It contains the\r\nsomewhat rare lines F 679, 680, which are quoted from it in the Six-text.\r\n\r\n20. Hatton, Donat. 1 (not the same MS. as Hatton 1); no. 4138 in Bernard\'s\r\nlist; in Tyrwhitt, \'B [epsilon].\' The Tales are in great disorder, the Man\r\nof Law being thrust in between the Reeve and the Cook, as in no other MS.\r\nIt contains Gamelyn. Lines F 679, 680 are quoted from it in the Six-text;\r\nand a few lines are again quoted from it at the end of the Parson\'s Tale.\r\n\r\n21. Rawlinson Poet. 149. Apparently of the D-type, but it is very\r\nimperfect, having lost several leaves in various places. A late MS.\r\n\r\n22. Rawlinson Poet. 141. Not a bad MS., but several Tales are omitted, and\r\nthe Shipman follows the Clerk. Groups C and G do not appear at all. The\r\nLatin side-notes are numerous.\r\n\r\n23. Rawlinson Poet. 223; the same as that called Rawl. Misc. 1133 in the\r\nSix-text \'Trial-table.\' No copy of Gamelyn. The Tales are strangely\r\nmisplaced. Slightly imperfect here and there.\r\n\r\n24. Corpus Christi College (Oxford), no. 198; denoted by CP. The best of\r\nthe Oxford MSS., printed in full as the fourth MS. in the Six-text edition.\r\nOf the C-type; collated throughout. It contains a copy of Gamelyn, which is\r\nduly printed. It is rather imperfect from the loss of leaves in various\r\nplaces; the gaps being usually supplied from the Selden MS. (no. 18 above).\r\n\r\n25. Christ Church (Oxford), no. 152. Contains Gamelyn. The Tales are\r\nextraordinarily arranged, but the MS. is nearly perfect, except at the end.\r\nA large part of the Parson\'s Tale, after I 550, being lost from the Hengwrt\r\nMS., the gap is supplied, in the Six-text, from this MS. and Addit. 5140.\r\nThe Second Nun follows the Shipman. Of the A-type.\r\n\r\n[xii] 26. New College (Oxford), no. 314; called \'NC\' in Tyrwhitt. Of the\r\nD-type; imperfect at the beginning. No copy of Gamelyn.\r\n\r\n27. Trinity College (Oxford), no. 49; containing 302 leaves; formerly in\r\nthe possession of John Leche, temp. Edw. IV. It contains Gamelyn. The Tales\r\nare misplaced; the Pardoner and Man of Law being thrust into the middle of\r\nGroup B, after the Prioress.\r\n\r\nIII. MSS. AT CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n28. University Library, Gg. 4. 27, not noticed by Tyrwhitt; here denoted by\r\nCM. Also denoted, in vol. iii., by C.; and in vol. i., by GG. A highly\r\nvaluable and important MS. of the A-type, printed as the third text in the\r\nSix-text edition. The best copy in any public library. See the description\r\nof \'Gg.\' in vol. i.; and the full description in the Library Catalogue.\r\n\r\n29. University Library, Dd. 4. 24; in Tyrwhitt, \'C 1.\' Quoted as DD. A good\r\nMS. of the A-type, much relied upon by Tyrwhitt, who made good use of it.\r\nHas lost several leaves. The whole of the Clerk\'s Tale was printed from\r\nthis MS. by Mr. Aldis Wright. The passage in B 4637-52 occurs only in this\r\nMS. and a few others, viz. Royal 17 D xv, Addit. 5140, and the Chr. Ch. MS.\r\nIt also contains the rare lines D 575-84, 609-12, 619-26, 717-20, all\r\nprinted from this MS. in the Six-text. Lines E 1213-44 are also quoted, to\r\nfill a gap in Cm.\r\n\r\n30. University Library, Ii. 3. 26; in Tyrwhitt, \'C 2.\' Of the D-type,\r\nincluding Gamelyn; but the Franklin\'s Tale is inserted after the Merchant.\r\nContains many corrupt readings.\r\n\r\n31. University Library, Mm. 2. 5. The arrangement of the Tales is very\r\nunusual, but resembles that in the Petworth MS., than which it is a little\r\nmore irregular. A complete MS. of the D-type, including Gamelyn.\r\n\r\n32. Trinity College (Cambridge), R. 3. 15; in Tyrwhitt, \'Tt.\' In quarto, on\r\npaper. Some leaves are missing, so that the Canon\'s Yeoman, Prioress, and\r\nSir Thopas are lost. Of the D-type, without Gamelyn.\r\n\r\n    N.B. This MS. also contains the three poems printed as Chaucer\'s\r\n    (though not his) in the edition of 1687, and numbered 66, 67, and 68,\r\n    in my Account of \'Speght\'s edition\' in vol. i. It also contains the\r\n    best MS. of Pierce the Ploughman\'s Crede, edited by me from this MS. in\r\n    1867.\r\n\r\n[xiii] 33. Trinity College (Cambridge), R. 3. 3; in Tyrwhitt, \'T.\' A folio\r\nMS., on vellum; of the D-type, without Gamelyn; but several Tales are\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\nIV.

The \'Ellesmere\' MS., in the possession of the Earl of Ellesmere;\r\ndenoted by E. It formerly belonged to the Duke of Bridgewater, and\r\nafterwards to the Marquis of Stafford. The finest and best of all the MSS.\r\nnow extant. Of the A-type; printed as the first of the MSS. in the\r\nSix-text, and taken as the basis of the present edition.\r\n\r\n    It contains the curious coloured drawings of 23 of the Canterbury\r\n    Pilgrims which have been reproduced for the Chaucer Society. At the end\r\n    of the MS. is a valuable copy of Chaucer\'s Balade of \'Truth\'; see vol.\r\n    i. At the beginning of the MS., in a later hand, are written two poems\r\n    printed in Todd\'s Illustrations of Gower, &c., pp. 295-309, which Todd\r\n    absurdly attributed to Chaucer! They are of slight value or interest.\r\n    It may suffice to say that, at the beginning of the former poem, we\r\n    find _revyved_ rimed with _meved_, and many of the lines in it are too\r\n    long; e.g.--\'I supposed yt to have been some noxiall fantasy.\' In the\r\n    latter poem, a compliment to the family of Vere, _by_ rimes with\r\n    _auncestrye_, and _quarter_ with _hereafter_; and the lines are of\r\n    similar over-length, e.g.--\'Of whom prophesyes of antiquite makyth\r\n    mencion.\'\r\n\r\n41. The \'Hengwrt\' MS., no. 154, belonging to Mr. Wm. W. E. Wynne, of\r\nPeniarth; denoted by HN. A valuable MS.; [xiv] it is really of the A-type,\r\nthough the Tales are strangely misplaced, and the Canon\'s Yeoman\'s Tale is\r\nmissing. The readings frequently agree so closely with those of E. (no. 40)\r\nthat it is, to some extent, almost a duplicate of it. Printed as the second\r\nMS. in the Six-text. It also contains Chaucer\'s Boethius (imperfect).\r\n\r\n42. The \'Petworth\' MS., belonging to Lord Leconfield; denoted by PT. A\r\nfolio MS., on vellum, of high value. Formerly in the possession of the Earl\r\nof Egremont (Todd\'s Illustrations, p. 118). Of the D-type, including\r\nGamelyn; but the Shipman and Prioress wrongly precede the Man of Law.\r\nPrinted as the fifth MS. in the Six-text.\r\n\r\n43. The \'Holkham\' MS., noted by Todd (Illustrations, p. 127) as then\r\nbelonging to Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, and now belonging to the Earl of\r\nLeicester. The Tales are out of order; perhaps the leaves are misarranged.\r\nImperfect in various places; has no Parson\'s Tale.\r\n\r\n44. The \'Helmingham\' MS., at Helmingham Hall, Suffolk, belonging to Lord\r\nTollemache. On paper and vellum; about 1460 A.D. For a specimen, see the\r\nShipman\'s Prologue, printed in the Six-text, in the Preface, p. ix*. Either\r\nof the C-type or the D-type.\r\n\r\n45-48. Four MSS. in the collection of the late Sir Thos. Phillipps, at\r\nCheltenham, viz. nos. 6570, 8136, 8137, 8299.\r\n\r\n    Two of these are mentioned in Todd\'s Illustrations, p. 127, as being\r\n    \'now [in 1810] in the collection of John P. Kemble, Esq., and in that\r\n    belonging to the late Duke of Roxburghe; the latter is remarkably\r\n    beautiful, and is believed to have been once the property of Sir Henry\r\n    Spelman.\' No. 8299 contains the Clerk\'s Tale only.\r\n\r\n49-52. Four MSS. belonging to the Earl of Ashburnham; numbered 124-127 in\r\nthe Appendix. Of these, no. 124 wants the end of the Man of Law\'s Tale and\r\nthe beginning of the Squire\'s, and therefore belongs to either the C-type\r\nor D-type. Nos. 125 and 126 are imperfect. No. 127 seems to be complete.\r\n\r\n53. A MS. belonging to the Duke of Devonshire, at Chatsworth; and formerly\r\nto Sir N. L\'Estrange. (Of the A-type.)\r\n\r\n54. A MS. belonging to Sir Henry Ingilby, of Ripley Castle, Yorkshire. (Of\r\nthe A-type.)\r\n\r\n55. A MS. belonging to the Duke of Northumberland, at Alnwick; and formerly\r\nto Mrs. Thynne. (Of the A-type.)\r\n\r\n[xv] 56. A MS. now (in 1891) in the possession of Lady Cardigan.\r\n\r\n57-59. Tyrwhitt uses the symbol \'Ask. 1\' to denote a MS. lent to him by the\r\nlate Dr. Askew. He also uses the symbols \'Ch.\' and \'N.\' to denote \'two MSS.\r\ndescribed in the Preface to Urry\'s edition, the one as belonging to Chas.\r\nCholmondeley, Esq. of Vale Royal, in Cheshire, and the other to Mr. Norton,\r\nof Southwick, in Hampshire.\' Of these, \'Ch.\' is now Lord Delamere\'s MS.,\r\ndescribed by Dr. Furnivall in Notes and Queries, 4 Ser. ix. 353. The others\r\nI cannot trace.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 3. THE PRINTED EDITIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the first five editions, the Canterbury Tales were published separately.\r\n\r\n1. Caxton; about 1477-8, from a poor MS. Copies are in the British Museum,\r\nMerton College, and in the Pepysian Library (no. 2053).\r\n\r\n2. Caxton; about 1483, from a better MS. A perfect copy exists in St.\r\nJohn\'s College Library, Oxford. Caxton bravely issued this new edition\r\nbecause he had found that his former one was faulty.\r\n\r\n3. Pynson; about 1493. Copied from Caxton\'s 2nd edition.\r\n\r\n4. Wynkyn de Worde; in 1498. In the British Museum.\r\n\r\n5. Pynson; in 1526. Copied from Caxton\'s 2nd edition.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Canterbury Tales were invariably issued with the rest of\r\nChaucer\'s Works, until after 1721. Some account of these editions is given\r\nin the Preface to the Minor Poems, in vol. i.; which see. They are:\r\nThynne\'s three editions, in 1532, 1542, and 1550 (the last is undated);\r\nStowe\'s edition, 1561; Speght\'s editions, in 1598, 1602, and 1687; Urry\'s\r\nedition, in 1721.\r\n\r\nTwo modernised editions of the Canterbury Tales were published in London in\r\n1737 or 1740, and in 1741.\r\n\r\nNext came: \'Chaucer\'s Canterbury Tales, to which is added, an Essay on his\r\nLanguage and Versification; an introductory discourse; notes, and a\r\nglossary. By Thomas Tyrwhitt, London, 1775-8, 8vo, 5 vols.\' A work of high\r\nliterary value, to which I am greatly indebted for many necessary notes.\r\nReprinted in 1798 in 4to, 2 vols., by the University of Oxford; and again,\r\nat London, in 1822, in post 8vo, 5 vols.; (by Pickering) in 1830, 8vo, 5\r\nvols.; [xvi] and (by Moxon) in 1845, in 1 vol. imp. 8vo. The last of these\r\nadds poor texts of the rest of Chaucer\'s Works, from old black-letter\r\neditions, with which Tyrwhitt had nothing to do. In Tyrwhitt\'s text, the\r\nnumber of grammatical errors is very large, and he frequently introduces\r\nwords into the text without authority. For some account of the later\r\neditions of Chaucer\'s Works, see the Introduction to the Legend of Good\r\nWomen, in vol. iii. I may note, by the way, that the editions by Wright,\r\nBell, and Morris are all founded on MS. Harl. 7334, a very unsafe MS. in\r\nsome respects; see p. viii (above).\r\n\r\n    It is necessary to add here a few words of warning. Wright\'s edition,\r\n    though it has many merits, turns out, in practice, to be dangerously\r\n    untrustworthy. He frequently inserts words, borrowed from Tyrwhitt\'s\r\n    edition (which he heartily condemns as being full of errors in\r\n    grammar), without the least indication that they are _not in the MS._\r\n    This becomes the more serious when we find, upon examination, that\r\n    Tyrwhitt had likewise no authority for some of such insertions, but\r\n    simply introduced them, by guess, to fill up a line in a way that\r\n    pleased him. For example, A 628 runs thus, in all the seven MSS.:--\r\n\r\n    \'Of his visage children were aferd.\' It is quite correct; for \'vis\xc3\xa1g-e\'\r\n    is trisyllabic. Tyrwhitt did not know this, and counted the syllables\r\n    as _two_ only, neglecting the final e. The line seemed then too short;\r\n    so he inserted _sore_ before _aferd_, thus ruining the scansion. Wright\r\n    follows suit, and inserts _sore_, though it is not in his MS.; giving\r\n    no notice at all of what he has done. Bell follows suit, and the word\r\n    is even preserved in Morris; but the latter prints the word in italics,\r\n    to shew that it is not in the MS. Nor is it in the Six-text.\r\n\r\n    I shall not adduce more instances, but shall content myself with saying\r\n    that, until the publications of the Chaucer Society appeared, no reader\r\n    had the means of knowing what the best MS. texts were really like. All\r\n    who have been accustomed to former (complete) editions have necessarily\r\n    imbibed hundreds of false impressions, and have necessarily accepted\r\n    numberless theories as to the scansion of lines which they will, in\r\n    course of due time, be prepared to abandon. In the course of my work,\r\n    it has been made clear to me that Chaucer\'s text has been manipulated\r\n    and sophisticated, frequently in most cunning and plausible ways, to a\r\n    far greater extent than I could have believed to be possible. This is\r\n    not a pleasant subject, and I only mention it for the use of scholars.\r\n    Such variations fortunately seldom affect the sense; but they vitiate\r\n    the scansion, the grammar, and the etymology in many cases. Of course\r\n    it will be understood that I am saying no more than I can fully\r\n    substantiate.\r\n\r\n    It is absolutely appalling to read such a statement as the following in\r\n    Bell\'s edition, vol. i. p. 60. \'All deviations, either from Mr.\r\n    Wright\'s edition, or from the original MS., are pointed out in the\r\n    footnotes for the ultimate satisfaction of the reader.\' For the\r\n    instances in which this is really done are very rare indeed, in spite\r\n    of the large number of such deviations.\r\n\r\n    Of Tyrwhitt\'s text, it is sufficient to remark that it was hardly\r\n    possible, at [xvii] that date, for a better text to have been produced.\r\n    The rules of Middle English grammar had not been formulated, so that we\r\n    are not surprised to find that he constantly makes the past tense of a\r\n    weak verb monosyllabic, when it should be dissyllabic, and treats the\r\n    past participle as dissyllabic, when it should be monosyllabic: which\r\n    makes wild work with the scansion. It is also to be regretted that he\r\n    based his text upon the faulty black-letter editions, though he took a\r\n    great deal of pains in collating them with various MSS.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, his literary notes are full of learning and\r\n    research; and the number of admirable illustrations by which he has\r\n    efficiently elucidated the text is very great. His reputation as one of\r\n    the foremost of our literary critics is thoroughly established, and\r\n    needs no comment.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wright\'s notes are likewise excellent, and resulted from a wide\r\n    reading. I have also found some most useful hints in the notes to\r\n    Bell\'s edition. Of all such sources of information I have been only too\r\n    glad to avail myself, as is more fully shewn in the succeeding volume.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 4. PLAN OF THE PRESENT EDITION.\r\n\r\nThe text of the present edition of the Canterbury Tales is founded upon\r\nthat of the Ellesmere MS. (E.) It has been collated throughout with that of\r\nthe other six MSS. published by the Chaucer Society. Of these seven MSS.,\r\nthe Harleian MS. 7334 (Hl.) was printed separately. The other six were\r\nprinted in the valuable \'Six-text\' edition, to which I constantly have\r\noccasion to refer, in parallel columns. The six MSS. are: E. (Ellesmere),\r\nHn. (Hengwrt), Cm. (Cambridge, Gg. 4. 27), Cp. (Corpus Coll., Oxford), Pt.\r\n(Petworth), and Ln. (Lansdowne). MSS. E. Hn. Cm. represent the earliest\r\ntype (A) of the text; Hl., a transitional type (B); Cp. and Ln., a still\r\nlater type (C); and Pt., the latest of all (D), but hardly differing from\r\nC.\r\n\r\nIn using these terms, \'earliest,\' &c., I do not refer to the age of the\r\nMSS., but to the type of text which they exhibit.\r\n\r\nIn the list of MSS. given above, Hl. is no. 1; E., Hn., Cm., are nos. 40,\r\n41, and 28; and Cp., Pt., Ln., are nos. 24, 42, and 10 respectively.\r\n\r\nOf all the MSS., E. is the best in nearly every respect. It not only gives\r\ngood lines and good sense, but is also (usually) grammatically accurate and\r\nthoroughly well spelt. The publication of it has been a very great boon to\r\nall Chaucer students, for which Dr. Furnivall will be ever gratefully\r\nremembered. We must not omit, at the same time, to recognise the liberality\r\nand generosity of the owner of the MS., who so freely permitted such full\r\nuse of it to be made; the same remark applies, equally, to the [xviii]\r\nowners of the Hengwrt and the Petworth MSS. The names of the Earl of\r\nEllesmere, Mr. Wm. W. E. Wynne of Peniarth, and Lord Leconfield have\r\ndeservedly become as \'familiar as household words\' to many a student of\r\nChaucer.\r\n\r\nThis splendid MS. has also the great merit of being complete, requiring no\r\nsupplement from any other source, except in the few cases where a line or\r\ntwo has been missed. For example, it does not contain A 252 _b-c_ (found in\r\nHn. only); nor A 2681-2 (also not in Hn. or Cm.); nor B 1163-1190 (also not\r\nin Hn. or Cm.); nor B 1995 (very rare indeed).\r\n\r\nIt is slightly imperfect in B 2510, 2514, 2525, 2526, 2623-4, 2746, 2967.\r\nIt drops B 3147-8, C 103-4, C 297-8 (not in Hn. Cm. Pt.), E 1358-61, G\r\n564-5; and has a few defects in the Parson\'s Tale in I 190, 273, &c. In the\r\nTale of Melibeus, the French original shews that _all_ the MSS. have lost B\r\n2252-3, 2623-4, which have to be supplied by translation.\r\n\r\nNone of the seven MSS. have B 4637-4652; these lines are genuine, but were\r\nprobably meant to be cancelled. They only occur, to my knowledge, in four\r\nMSS., nos. 7, 11, 25, and 29; though found also in the old black-letter\r\neditions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, E. preserves lines rarely found elsewhere. Such are A\r\n3155-6, 3721-2, F 1455-6, 1493-9; twelve genuine lines, none of which are\r\nin Tyrwhitt, and only the first two are in Wright. Observe also the stanza\r\nin the footnote to p. 424; with which compare B 3083, on p. 241.\r\n\r\nThe text of the Ellesmere MS. has only been corrected in cases where\r\ncareful collation suggests a desirable improvement. Every instance of this\r\ncharacter is invariably recorded in the footnotes. Thus, in A 8, the\r\ngrammar and scansion require _half-e_, not _half_; though, curiously\r\nenough, this correct form appears in Hl. only, among all the seven MSS. In\r\nvery difficult cases, other MSS. (besides the seven) have been collated,\r\nbut I have seldom gained much by it. The chief additional MSS. thus used\r\nare Dd.= Cambridge, Dd. 4. 24 (no. 29 above); Slo. or Sl. = Sloane 1685\r\n(no. 8); Roy. or Rl. = Royal 18 C 2 (no. 6); Harl. = Harleian 1758 (see p.\r\n645); Li. or Lich. = Lichfield MS. (no. 35), for the Canon\'s Yeoman\'s Tale;\r\nand others that are sufficiently indicated.\r\n\r\nI have paid especial attention to the suffixes required by Middle-English\r\ngrammar, to the scansion, and to the pronunciation; and I suppose that this\r\nis the first complete edition in which the [xix] spelling has been tested\r\nby phonetic considerations. With a view to making the spelling a little\r\nclearer and more consistent, I have ventured to adopt certain methods which\r\nI here explain.\r\n\r\nIn certain words of variable spelling in E., such as _whan_ or _whanne,\r\nthan_ or _thanne_, I have adopted that form which the scansion requires;\r\nbut the MS. is usually right.\r\n\r\nE. usually has _hise_ for _his_ with a plural sb., as in l. 1; I use _his_\r\nalways, except in prose. E. has _hir, here_, for her, their; I use _hir_\r\nonly, except at the end of a line.\r\n\r\nE. uses the endings _-ight_ or _-yght_, _-inde_ or _-ynde_; I use _-ight_\r\n_-inde_ only; and, in general, I use _i_ to represent short _i_, and _y_ to\r\nrepresent long _i_, as in _king, wyf_. Such is the usual habit of the\r\nscribe, but he often changes _i_ into _y_ before _m_ and _n_, to make his\r\nwriting clearer; such a precaution is needless in modern printing. Thus, in\r\nl. 42, I replace the scribe\'s _bigynne_ by _biginne_; and in l. 78, I\r\nreplace his _pilgrymage_ by _pilgrimage_. This makes the text easier to\r\nread.\r\n\r\nFor a like reason, where equivalent spellings occur, I select the simpler;\r\nwriting _couthe_ (as in Pt.) for _kowthe_, _sote_ for _soote_, _sege_ for\r\n_seege_, and so on. In words such as _our_ or _oure_, _your_ or _youre_,\r\n_hir_ or _hire_, _neuer_ or _neuere_, I usually give the simpler forms,\r\nwithout the final _-e_, when the _-e_ is obviously silent.\r\n\r\nFor consonantal _u_, as in _neuer_, I write _v_, as in _never_. This is\r\nusual in all editions. But I could not bring myself to use _j_ for _i_\r\nconsonant; the anachronism is too great. _Never_ for _neuer_ is common in\r\nthe fifteenth century, but _j_ does not occur even in the first folio of\r\nShakespeare. I therefore usually keep the capital _i_ of the MSS. and of\r\nthe Elizabethan printers, as in _Ioye_ (=_joye_) where initial, and the\r\nsmall _i_, as in _enioinen_=_enjoinen_) elsewhere. Those who dislike such\r\nconservatism may be comforted by the reflection that the sound rarely\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nThe word _eye_ has to be altered to _y\xc3\xab_ at the end of a line, to preserve\r\nthe rimes. The scribes usually write _eye_ in the middle of a line, but\r\nwhen they come to it at the end of one, they are fairly puzzled. In l. 10,\r\nthe scribe of Hn. writes _Iye_, and that of Ln. writes _yhe_; and the\r\nvariations on this theme are most curious. The spelling _ye_ (=_y\xc3\xab_) is,\r\nhowever, common; as in A 1096 (Cm., Pt.). I print it \'y\xc3\xab\' to distinguish it\r\nfrom _ye_, the pl. pronoun.\r\n\r\nThese minute variations are, I trust, legitimate, and I have not recorded\r\nthem. They cause trouble to the editor, but afford ease [xx] to the reader,\r\nwhich seems a sufficient justification for adopting them. But the\r\nscrupulous critic need not fear that the MS. has been departed from in any\r\ncase, where it could make any phonetic difference, without due notice.\r\nThus, in l. 9, where I have changed _foweles_ into _fowles_ as being a more\r\nusual form, the fact that _foweles_ is the Ellesmere spelling is duly\r\nrecorded in the footnotes. And so in other cases.\r\n\r\nThe footnotes do not record various readings where E. is correct as it\r\nstands; they have purposely been made as concise as possible. It would have\r\nbeen easy to multiply them fourfold without giving much information of\r\nvalue; this is not unfrequently done, but the gain is slight. With so good\r\na MS. as the basis of the text, it did not seem desirable.\r\n\r\n    The following methods for shortening the footnotes have been adopted.\r\n\r\n    1. Sometimes only the readings of _some_ of the MSS. are given. Thus at\r\n    l. 9 (p. 1), I omit the readings of Cp. and of Cm. As a fact, neither\r\n    of these MSS. contain the line; but it was not worth while to take up\r\n    space by saying so. At l. 10 (p. 1), I again omit the readings of Cp.\r\n    and of Cm., for the same reason; also of Ln., which is a poor MS.,\r\n    though here it agrees with Hl. (having _yhe_); also of Pt., which has\r\n    _eyghe_, a spelling not here to be thought of. At l. 12, I just note\r\n    that E. has _pilgrimage_ (by mistake); of course this means that it\r\n    should have had _pilgrimages_ in the plural, as in other MSS., and as\r\n    required by the rime.\r\n\r\n    2. At l. 23 (p. 2), the remark \'_rest_ was\' implies that all the rest\r\n    of the seven MSS. specially collated have \'was.\' The word \'_rest_\' is a\r\n    convenient abbreviation.\r\n\r\n    3. When, as at l. 53, I give _nacions_ as a rejected reading of E. in\r\n    the footnote, it will be understood that _naciouns_ is a better\r\n    spelling, justified by other MSS., and by other lines in E. itself.\r\n    E.g., _naciouns_ occurs in Hl. and Pt., and Cm. has _naciounnys_.\r\n\r\n    4. I often use \'_om._\' for \'_omit_,\' or \'_omits_\' as in the footnote to\r\n    l. 188 (p. 6).\r\n\r\n    5. At l. 335 (p. 11), I give the footnote:--\'ever] Hl. al.\' This means\r\n    that MS. Hl. has _al_ instead of the word _ever_ of the other MSS. It\r\n    seemed worth noting; but _ever_ is probably right.\r\n\r\n    6. At l. 520 (p. 16), the note is:--\'_All but_ Hl. this was.\' That is,\r\n    Hl. has _was_, as in the text; the rest have _this was_, where the\r\n    addition of _this_ sadly clogs the line.\r\n\r\n    With these hints, the footnotes present no difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, I have refrained from all emendation; but, in B 1189, I have\r\nventured to suggest _physices_[3], for reasons explained in the Notes.\r\nThose who prefer the reading _Phislyas_ can adopt it.\r\n\r\nFor further details regarding particular passages, I beg leave to refer the\r\nreader to the Notes in vol. v.\r\n\r\n[xxi]\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 5.

In the Prologue, after l. 250, his\r\nnumbering is given within marks of parenthesis.\r\n\r\nThe lines in every piece are also numbered _separately_, within marks of\r\nparenthesis, as (10), (20), on p. 26. This numbering (borrowed from Dr.\r\nMurray) agrees with the references given in the New English Dictionary. It\r\nalso gives, in most cases, either exactly or approximately, the references\r\nto Dr. Morris\'s edition, who adopts a similar method, with a few variations\r\nof detail. The lines in Bell\'s edition are not numbered at all.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the order in Wright\'s edition, see pp. 1-164, 320-554, 289\r\n(footnote), 290-319, 165-289, 555-end. The variations are fewer.\r\n\r\nSome may find it more convenient to observe the names of the Tales.\r\n\r\n[xxiii] Tyrwhitt\'s order of the Tales is as follows[11]:--Prologue, Knight,\r\nMiller, Reeve, Cook--Man of Lawe--Wife, Friar, Somnour--Clerk,\r\nMerchant--Squire, Franklin--Doctor (Physician), Pardoner--Shipman,\r\nPrioress, Sir Thopas, Melibeus, Monk[12], Nun\'s Priest--Second Nun, Canon\'s\r\nYeoman--Manciple--Parson.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa77. THE FOUR LEADING TYPES OF THE MSS.\r\n\r\nThe four leading types of MSS. usually exhibit a variation in the order of\r\nthe Tales, as well as many minor differences. I only note here the former\r\n(omitting Gamelyn, which is absent from MSS. of the A-type, and from some\r\nof the D-type).\r\n\r\n  A.--1. Prologue, Knight, Miller, Reeve, Cook.\r\n      2. Man of Lawe.\r\n      3. Wife of Bath, Friar, Sompnour.\r\n      4. Clerk, Merchant.\r\n      5. Squire, Franklin.\r\n      6. Doctor, Pardoner.\r\n      7. Shipman, Prioress, Sir Thopas, Melibeus, Monk, Nun\'s Priest.\r\n      8. Second Nun, Canon\'s Yeoman.\r\n      9. Manciple, (_slightly linked to_) Parson.\r\n\r\n  B.--Places 8 before 6. Order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 9.\r\n\r\n  C.--Not only places 8 before 6 (as B), but splits 5 into 5 a\r\n  (Squire) and 5 b (Franklin), and places 5 a before 3. Order: 1,\r\n  2, 5 a, 3, 4, 5 b, 8, 6, 7, 9.\r\n\r\n  D.--As C, but further splits 4 into 4 a (Clerk), and 4 b\r\n  (Merchant), and places 4 b after 5 a. Order: 1, 2, 5 a, 4 b, 3, 4 a,\r\n  5 b, 8, 6, 7, 9. (D. is really a mere variety of C., with an external\r\n  difference.)\r\n\r\nObserve the position of the Franklin. Thus: A. Squire, Franklin, Doctor. B.\r\nSquire, Franklin, Second Nun. C. Merchant, Franklin, Second Nun. D. Clerk,\r\nFranklin, Second Nun.\r\n\r\nFor further remarks on this subject, see vol. v.\r\n\r\n[xxiv] ERRATA\r\n\r\n    N.B. The following are all the Errata that I have observed.

Troil. i. 287.\r\n\r\n    The metre exhibits the nine-line stanza, as in Anelida, 211-9; but the\r\n    same rimes recur in all three stanzas. The six-line Envoy, with the\r\n    rime-formula _a b a b a a_, is unique in Chaucer. There are nineteen\r\n    lines ending in _-aunce_, twelve in _-esse_, and two in _-ede_.\r\n\r\n    1. Note how ll. 1 and 2 are re-echoed in ll. 32, 33. For a similar\r\n    effect, see Anelida, 211, 350.\r\n\r\n    8. _ful chose_, fully chosen; parallel to _ful drive_ in C. T., F 1230.\r\n\r\n    14. _souvenance_, remembrance; not found elswhere in Chaucer.\r\n\r\n    16. _humblely_ is trisyllabic; see Leg. 156, Troil. ii. 1719, v. 1354.\r\n\r\n    20. _lo_ emphasises _swich_; cf. _lo, this_, T. v. 54; _lo, which_, T.\r\n    iv. 1231.\r\n\r\n    22. _allegeaunce_, _alleviation_; the verb _allegge_ is in the\r\n    Glossary.\r\n\r\n    26. _outrance_, extreme violence, great hurt; see Godefroy.\r\n\r\n    27. _unbuxumnesse_, unsubmissiveness; cf. _buxumnesse_, Truth, 15.\r\n\r\n    XXV.--I take the title from l. 26; cf. Compl. to his Lady, 41, 64.\r\n\r\n    1. Cf. Amorous Complaint, 87; Troil. v. 1318, i. 960.\r\n\r\n    3. \'Love hath me taught no more of his art,\' &c.; Compl. to his Lady,\r\n    42-3.\r\n\r\n    9. Cf. Compl. of Mars, 13, 14; p. xxx above, l. 43; Parl. Foules,\r\n    386-9; Amorous Complaint, 85-6.\r\n\r\n    19. _eche_, augment; \'hir sorwes _eche_,\' T. i. 705.\r\n\r\n    27. \'And to your trouthe ay I me recomaunde;\' T. v. 1414. \'I am a\r\n    _boistous_ man;\' C.

Perhaps read _hertes sorwes leche_; see T. ii. 1066.\r\n\r\n    10. Cf. \'as _in_ his speche;\' T. ii. 1069.\r\n\r\n    26. _impresse_; cf. T. ii. 1371.\r\n\r\n    [xxxii] 28. _spille_; cf. Compl. to his Lady, 121.\r\n\r\n    32. _reyne_, bridle. For this image, cf. Anelida, 184.\r\n\r\n    39. MS. _deth the kerue_. As _e_ and _o_ are constantly confused, the\r\n    prefix _to_ (written apart) may have looked like _te_, and would easily\r\n    be altered to _the_. Cf. _forkerveth_ in the Manc. Tale, H 340.\r\n\r\n    47. Here _spac-e_ rimes with _embrac-e_, but in l. 5 it rimes with\r\n    _allas_. This variation is no worse than the riming of _embrace_ with\r\n    _compas_ in Proverbs, 8 (vol. i. p. 407). Cf. _plac-e_ in C.T., B 1910,\r\n    with its variant _plas_, B 1971.\r\n\r\n    N.B. The Complaints numbered XXV and XXVI are obviously by the same\r\n    author; compare XXV. 26 with XXVI. 15; XXV. 9 with XXVI. 43; and XXV.\r\n    29-31 with XXVI. 39, 40.

That oon of hem is solempne,\r\nanother is commune, and the thridde is privee. / Thilke penance that is\r\nsolempne, is in two maneres; as to be put out of holy chirche in lente, for\r\nslaughtre of children, and swich maner thing. / Another is, whan a man hath\r\nsinned openly, of which sinne the fame is openly spoken in the contree; and\r\nthanne holy chirche by Iugement destreineth him for to do open penaunce. /\r\nCommune penaunce is that preestes enioinen men comunly in certeyn caas; as\r\nfor to goon, peraventure, naked in pilgrimages, or bare-foot. /105 Privee\r\npenaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee sinnes, of whiche we\r\nshryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce. /\r\n\r\n    102.

And this stant on three thinges; / Contricioun of herte,\r\nConfessioun of Mouth, and Satisfaccioun. / For which seith Seint Iohn\r\nCrisostom: \'Penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benignely every peyne\r\nthat him is enioyned, with contricion of herte, and shrift of mouth, with\r\nsatisfaccion; and in werkinge of alle maner humilitee.\' / And this is\r\nfruitful Penitence agayn three thinges in whiche we wratthe oure lord Iesu\r\nCrist: /110 this is to seyn, by delyt in thinkinge, by recchelesnesse in\r\nspekinge, and by wikked sinful werkinge. / And agayns thise wikkede giltes\r\nis Penitence, that may be lykned un-to a tree. /\r\n\r\n    107.

The rote of this tree is Contricion, that hydeth him in the herte of\r\nhim that is verray repentant, right as the rote of a tree hydeth him in the\r\nerthe. / Of the rote of Contricion springeth a stalke, that bereth\r\nbraunches and leves of Confession, and fruit of Satisfaccion. / For which\r\nCrist seith in his gospel: \'dooth digne fruit of Penitence\'; for by this\r\nfruit may men knowe this tree, and nat by the rote that is hid in the herte\r\nof man, ne by the braunches ne by the leves of Confession. /115 And\r\ntherefore oure Lord Iesu Crist seith thus: \'by the fruit of hem ye shul\r\nknowen hem.\' / Of this rote eek springeth a seed of grace, the which seed\r\nis moder of sikernesse, and this seed is egre and [573] hoot. / The grace\r\nof this seed springeth of god, thurgh remembrance of the day of dome and on\r\nthe peynes of helle. / Of this matere seith Salomon, that \'in the drede of\r\ngod man forleteth his sinne.\' / The hete of this seed is the love of god,\r\nand the desiring of the Ioye perdurable. /120 This hete draweth the herte\r\nof a man to god, and dooth him haten his sinne. / For soothly, ther is\r\nno-thing that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk of his norice, ne\r\nno-thing is to him more abhominable than thilke milk whan it is medled with\r\nother mete. / Right so the sinful man that loveth his sinne, him semeth\r\nthat it is to him most swete of any-thing; / but fro that tyme that he\r\nloveth sadly our lord Iesu Crist, and desireth the lif perdurable, ther nis\r\nto him no-thing more abhominable. / For soothly, the lawe of god is the\r\nlove of god; for which David the prophete seith: \'I have loved thy lawe and\r\nhated wikkednesse and hate\'; he that loveth god kepeth his lawe and his\r\nword. /125 This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit, up-on the avision\r\nof the king Nabugodonosor, whan he conseiled him to do penitence. /\r\nPenaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receiven, and he that holdeth\r\nhim in verray penitence is blessed; after the sentence of Salomon. /\r\n\r\n    117.

In this Penitence or Contricion man shal understonde foure thinges,\r\nthat is to seyn, what is Contricion: and whiche been the causes that moeven\r\na man to Contricion: and how he sholde be contrit: and what Contricion\r\navailleth to the soule. / Thanne is it thus: that Contricion is the verray\r\nsorwe that a man receiveth in his herte for his sinnes, with sad purpos to\r\nshryve him, and to do penaunce, and nevermore to do sinne. / And this sorwe\r\nshal been in this manere, as seith seint Bernard: \'it shal been hevy and\r\ngrevous, and ful sharpe and poinant in herte.\' /130 First, for man hath\r\nagilt his lord and his creatour; and more sharpe and poinant, for he hath\r\nagilt his fader celestial; / and yet more sharpe and poinant, for he hath\r\nwrathed and agilt him that boghte him; which with his precious blood hath\r\ndelivered us fro the bondes of sinne, and fro the crueltee of the devel and\r\nfro the peynes of helle. /\r\n\r\n    131. Cp. agult; Hl. agiltid.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 8. The causes that oghte moeve a man to Contricion been six. First, a man\r\nshal remembre him of hise sinnes; / but loke [574] he that thilke\r\nremembrance ne be to him no delyt by no wey, but greet shame and sorwe for\r\nhis gilt. For Iob seith: \'sinful men doon werkes worthy of Confession.\' /\r\nAnd therfore seith Ezechie: \'I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf, in\r\nbitternesse of myn herte.\' /135 And god seith in the Apocalips: remembreth\r\nyow fro whennes that ye been falle\'; for biforn that tyme that ye sinned,\r\nye were the children of god, and limes of the regne of god; / but for your\r\nsinne ye been woxen thral and foul, and membres of the feend, hate of\r\naungels, sclaundre of holy chirche, and fode of the false serpent;\r\nperpetuel matere of the fyr of helle. / And yet more foul and abhominable,\r\nfor ye trespassen so ofte tyme, as doth the hound that retourneth to eten\r\nhis spewing. / And yet be ye fouler for your longe continuing in sinne and\r\nyour sinful usage, for which ye be roten in your sinne, as a beest in his\r\ndong. / Swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his sinne,\r\nand no delyt, as god seith by the prophete Ezechiel: /140 \'ye shal remembre\r\nyow of youre weyes, and they shuln displese yow.\' Sothly, sinnes been the\r\nweyes that leden folk to helle. /\r\n\r\n    134.

The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of sinne is\r\nthis: that, as seith seint Peter, \'who-so that doth sinne is thral of\r\nsinne\'; and sinne put a man in greet thraldom. / And therfore seith the\r\nprophete Ezechiel: \'I wente sorweful in desdayn of my-self.\' And certes,\r\nwel oghte a man have desdayn of sinne, and withdrawe him from that thraldom\r\nand vileinye. / And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere. He seith thus:\r\n\'though I wiste that neither god ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it, yet\r\nwolde I have desdayn for to do sinne.\' / And the same Seneca also seith: \'I\r\nam born to gretter thinges than to be thral to my body, or than for to\r\nmaken of my body a thral.\' /145 Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman\r\nmaken of his body, than for to yeven his body to sinne. / Al were it the\r\nfouleste cherl, or the fouleste womman that liveth, and leest of value, yet\r\nis he thanne more foule and more in servitute. / Evere fro the hyer degree\r\nthat man falleth, the more is he thral, and more to god and to the world\r\nvile and abhominable. / O gode god, wel oghte [575] man have desdayn of\r\nsinne; sith that, thurgh sinne, ther he was free, now is he maked bonde. /\r\nAnd therfore seyth Seint Augustin: \'if thou hast desdayn of thy servant, if\r\nhe agilte or sinne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thy-self sholdest do\r\nsinne.\' /150 Take reward of thy value, that thou ne be to foul to thy-self.\r\n/ Allas! wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles\r\nto sinne, and sore been ashamed of hem-self, / that god of his endelees\r\ngoodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of\r\nbody, hele, beautee, prosperitee, / and boghte hem fro the deeth with his\r\nherte blood, that they so unkindely, agayns his gentilesse, quyten him so\r\nvileinsly, to slaughtre of hir owene soules. / O gode god, ye wommen that\r\nbeen of so greet beautee, remembreth yow of the proverbe of Salomon, that\r\nseith: /155 \'he lykneth a fair womman, that is a fool of hir body, lyk to a\r\nring of gold that were in the groyn of a sowe.\' / For right as a sowe\r\nwroteth in everich ordure, so wroteth she hir beautee in the stinkinge\r\nordure of sinne. /\r\n\r\n    143.

And venial synne is it, if man love\r\nIesu Crist lasse than him oghte. / For sothe, the dede of this venial sinne\r\nis ful perilous; for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han to god more\r\nand more. / And therfore, if a man charge him-self with manye swiche venial\r\nsinnes, certes, but-if so be that he som tyme descharge him of hem by\r\nshrifte, they mowe ful lightly amenuse in him al the love that he hath to\r\nIesu Crist; /360 and in this wise skippeth venial in-to deedly sinne. For\r\ncertes, the more that a man chargeth his soule with venial sinnes, the more\r\nis he enclyned to fallen in-to deedly sinne. / And therfore, lat us nat be\r\nnecligent to deschargen us of venial sinnes.

Alwey he maketh a \'but\'\r\natte laste ende, that is digne of more blame, than worth is al the\r\npreisinge. / The seconde spece is, that if a man be good and dooth or seith\r\na thing to good entente, the bakbyter wol turne all thilke goodnesse\r\nup-so-doun to his shrewed entente. /495 The thridde is, to amenuse the\r\nbountee of his neighebore. / The fourthe spece of bakbyting is this; that\r\nif men speke goodnesse of a man, thanne wol the bakbyter seyn, \'parfey,\r\nswich a man is yet bet than he\'; in dispreisinge of him that men preise. /\r\nThe fifte spece is this; for to consente gladly and herkne gladly to the\r\nharm that men speke of other folk.

Now wol I speke of the remedie agayns this foule sinne of Envye.\r\nFirst, is the love of god principal, and loving of his neighebor as\r\nhim-self; for soothly, that oon ne may nat been withoute that other. /515\r\nAnd truste wel, that in the name of thy neighebore thou shalt understonde\r\nthe name of thy brother; for certes alle we have o fader fleshly, and o\r\nmoder, that is to seyn, Adam and Eve; and eek o fader espirituel, and that\r\nis god of hevene. / Thy neighebore artow holden for to love, and wilne him\r\nalle goodnesse; and therfore seith god, \'love thy neighebore as thyselve,\'\r\nthat is to seyn, to salvacion bothe of lyf and of soule. / And more-over,\r\nthou shalt love him in word, and in benigne amonestinge, and chastysinge;\r\nand conforten him in hise anoyes, and preye [601] for him with al thyn\r\nherte. / And in dede thou shall love him in swich wyse, that thou shalt\r\ndoon to him in charitee as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene\r\npersone. / And therfore, thou ne shalt doon him no damage in wikked word,\r\nne harm in his body, ne in his catel, ne in his soule, by entysing of\r\nwikked ensample. /520 Thou shalt nat desyren his wyf, ne none of hise\r\nthinges. Understond eek, that in the name of neighebor is comprehended his\r\nenemy. / Certes man shal loven his enemy by the comandement of god; and\r\nsoothly thy frend shaltow love in God. / I seye, thyn enemy shaltow love\r\nfor goddes sake, by his comandement. For if it were reson that a man sholde\r\nhaten his enemy, for sothe god nolde nat receiven us to his love that been\r\nhise enemys. / Agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym,\r\nhe shal doon three thinges, as thus. / Agayns hate and rancour of herte, he\r\nshal love him in herte. Agayns chyding and wikkede wordes, he shal preye\r\nfor his enemy. And agayn the wikked dede of his enemy, he shal doon him\r\nbountee. /525 For Crist seith, \'loveth youre enemys, and preyeth for hem\r\nthat speke yow harm; and eek for hem that yow chacen and pursewen, and doth\r\nbountee to hem that yow haten.\' Lo, thus comaundeth us oure lord Iesu\r\nCrist, to do to oure enemys. / For soothly, nature dryveth us to loven oure\r\nfreendes, and parfey, oure enemys han more nede to love than oure freendes;\r\nand they that more nede have, certes, to hem shal men doon goodnesse; / and\r\ncertes, in thilke dede have we remembrance of the love of Iesu Crist, that\r\ndeyde for hise enemys. / And in-as-muche as thilke love is the more grevous\r\nto perfourne, in-so-muche is the more gretter the merite; and therfore the\r\nlovinge of oure enemy hath confounded the venim of the devel. / For right\r\nas the devel is disconfited by humilitee, right so is he wounded to the\r\ndeeth by love of oure enemy. /530 Certes, thanne is love the medicine that\r\ncasteth out the venim of Envye fro mannes herte. / The speces of this pas\r\nshullen be more largely in hir chapitres folwinge declared. /\r\n\r\n    515. this] E. the.   love] E. louynge.   516.

For soothly, who-so\r\nhath envye upon his neighebor, anon he wole comunly [602] finde him a\r\nmatere of wratthe, in word or in dede, agayns him to whom he hath envye. /\r\nAnd as wel comth Ire of Pryde, as of Envye; for soothly, he that is proude\r\nor envious is lightly wrooth. /\r\n\r\n    533. Hn. Pt. Ln. _om._ a _bef._ matere.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 33. This sinne of Ire, after the discryving of seint Augustin, is wikked\r\nwil to been avenged by word or by dede. /535 Ire, after the philosophre, is\r\nthe fervent blood of man y-quiked in his herte, thurgh which he wole harm\r\nto him that he hateth. / For certes the herte of man, by eschaufinge and\r\nmoevinge of his blood, wexeth so trouble, that he is out of alle Iugement\r\nof resoun. / But ye shal understonde that Ire is in two maneres; that oon\r\nof hem is good, and that other is wikked. / The gode Ire is by Ialousye of\r\ngoodnesse, thurgh which a man is wrooth with wikkednesse and agayns\r\nwikkednesse; and therfore seith a wys man, that \'Ire is bet than pley.\' /\r\nThis Ire is with debonairetee, and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse; nat\r\nwrooth agayns the man, but wrooth with the misdede of the man; as seith the\r\nprophete David, _Irascimini et nolite peccare_. /540 Now understondeth,\r\nthat wikked Ire is in two maneres, that is to seyn, sodeyn Ire or hastif\r\nIre, withouten avisement and consentinge of resoun. / The mening and the\r\nsens of this is, that the resoun of man ne consente nat to thilke sodeyn\r\nIre; and thanne it is venial. / Another Ire is ful wikked, that comth of\r\nfelonye of herte avysed and cast biforn; with wikked wil to do vengeance,\r\nand therto his resoun consenteth; and soothly this is deedly sinne. / This\r\nIre is so displesant to god, that it troubleth his hous and chaceth the\r\nholy goost out of mannes soule, and wasteth and destroyeth the lyknesse of\r\ngod, that is to seyn, the vertu that is in mannes soule; / and put in him\r\nthe lyknesse of the devel, and binimeth the man fro god that is his\r\nrightful lord. /545 This Ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel; for it\r\nis the develes fourneys, that is eschaufed with the fyr of helle. / For\r\ncertes, right so as fyr is more mighty to destroyen erthely thinges than\r\nany other element, right so Ire is mighty to destroyen alle spirituel\r\nthinges. / Loke how that fyr of smale gledes, that been almost dede under\r\nasshen, wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brimstoon; right so\r\nIre wol everemo quiken agayn, whan it is touched by the pryde that is\r\ncovered in mannes herte. / For certes fyr ne may nat comen out of no-thing,\r\nbut-if it were first in the same thing naturelly; as fyr is drawen out of\r\nflintes [603] with steel. / And right so as pryde is ofte tyme matere of\r\nIre, right so is rancour norice and keper of Ire. /550 Ther is a maner\r\ntree, as seith seint Isidre, that whan men maken fyr of thilke tree, and\r\ncovere the coles of it with asshen, soothly the fyr of it wol lasten al a\r\nyeer or more. / And right so fareth it of rancour; whan it is ones\r\nconceyved in the hertes of som men, certein, it wol lasten peraventure from\r\noon Estre-day unto another Estre-day, and more. / But certes, thilke man is\r\nful fer fro the mercy of god al thilke while. /\r\n\r\n    547.

For soothly, almost al the harm that any man\r\ndooth to his neighebore comth of wratthe. / For certes, outrageous wratthe\r\ndoth al that evere the devel him comaundeth; for he ne spareth neither\r\nCrist, ne his swete mooder. / And in his outrageous anger and Ire, allas!\r\nallas! ful many oon at that tyme feleth in his herte ful wikkedly, bothe of\r\nCrist and of alle hise halwes. / Is nat this a cursed vice?

Of Ire comen thise stinkinge engendrures: first hate, that is old\r\nwratthe; discord, thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he hath\r\nloved ful longe. / And thanne cometh werre, and every manere of wrong that\r\nman dooth to his neighebore, in body or in catel. / Of this cursed sinne of\r\nIre cometh eek manslaughtre. And understonde wel, that homicyde, that is\r\nmanslaughtre, is in dyverse wyse. Som manere of homicyde is spirituel, and\r\nsom is bodily. / Spirituel manslaughtre is in six [604] thinges. First, by\r\nhate; as seint Iohn seith, \'he that hateth his brother is homicyde.\' /565\r\nHomicyde is eek by bakbytinge; of whiche bakbyteres seith Salomon, that\r\n\'they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hir neighebores.\' For soothly,\r\nas wikke is to binime his good name as his lyf. / Homicyde is eek, in\r\nyevinge of wikked conseil by fraude; as for to yeven conseil to areysen\r\nwrongful custumes and taillages. / Of whiche seith Salomon, \'Leon rorynge\r\nand bere hongry been lyke to the cruel lordshipes,\' in withholdinge or\r\nabregginge of the shepe (or the hyre), or of the wages of servaunts, or\r\nelles in usure or in withdrawinge of the almesse of povre folk. / For which\r\nthe wyse man seith, \'fedeth him that almost dyeth for honger\'; for soothly,\r\nbut-if thou fede him, thou sleest him; and alle thise been deadly sinnes. /\r\nBodily manslaughtre is, whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in other\r\nmanere; as whan thou comandest to sleen a man, or elles yevest him conseil\r\nto sleen a man. /570 Manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres. That oon is\r\nby lawe; right as a Iustice dampneth him that is coupable to the deeth. But\r\nlat the Iustice be war that he do it rightfully, and that he do it nat for\r\ndelyt to spille blood, but for kepinge of rightwisenesse. / Another\r\nhomicyde is, that is doon for necessitee, as whan o man sleeth another in\r\nhis defendaunt, and that he ne may noon otherwise escape from his owene\r\ndeeth. / But certeinly, if he may escape withouten manslaughtre of his\r\nadversarie, and sleeth him, he doth sinne, and he shal bere penance as for\r\ndeedly sinne. / Eek if a man, by caas or aventure, shete an arwe or caste a\r\nstoon with which he sleeth a man, he is homicyde. / Eek if a womman by\r\nnecligence overlyeth hir child in hir sleping, it is homicyde and deedly\r\nsinne. /575 Eek whan man destourbeth concepcion of a child, and maketh a\r\nwomman outher bareyne by drinkinge venemouse herbes, thurgh which she may\r\nnat conceyve, or sleeth a child by drinkes wilfully, or elles putteth\r\ncerteine material thinges in hir secree places to slee the child; / or\r\nelles doth unkindely sinne, by which man or womman shedeth hir nature in\r\nmanere or in place ther-as a child may nat be conceived; or elles, if a\r\nwomman have conceyved and hurt hir-self, [605] and sleeth the child, yet is\r\nit homicyde. / What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for\r\ndrede of worldly shame? Certes, an horrible homicyde. / Homicyde is eek if\r\na man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherye, thurgh which the child\r\nis perissed, or elles smyteth a womman witingly, thurgh which she leseth\r\nhir child. Alle thise been homicydes and horrible deedly sinnes. / Yet\r\ncomen ther of Ire manye mo sinnes, as wel in word as in thoght and in dede;\r\nas he that arretteth upon god, or blameth god, of thing of which he is\r\nhim-self gilty; or despyseth god and alle hise halwes, as doon thise\r\ncursede hasardours in diverse contrees. /580 This cursed sinne doon they,\r\nwhan they felen in hir hertes ful wikkedly of god and of hise halwes. /\r\nAlso, whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter, thilke\r\nsinne is so greet, that unnethe may it been relesed, but that the mercy of\r\ngod passeth alle hise werkes; it is so greet and he so benigne. / Thanne\r\ncomth of Ire attry angre; whan a man is sharply amonested in his shrifte to\r\nforleten his sinne, / than wole he be angry and answeren hokerly and\r\nangrily, and deffenden or excusen his sinne by unstedefastnesse of his\r\nflesh; or elles he dide it for to holde companye with hise felawes, or\r\nelles, he seith, the fend entyced him; / or elles he dide it for his\r\nyouthe, or elles his complexioun is so corageous, that he may nat forbere;\r\nor elles it is his destinee, as he seith, unto a certein age; or elles, he\r\nseith, it cometh him of gentillesse of hise auncestres; and semblable\r\nthinges. /585 Alle this manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir sinnes, that\r\nthey ne wol nat delivere hem-self. For soothly, no wight that excuseth him\r\nwilfully of his sinne may nat been delivered of his sinne, til that he\r\nmekely biknoweth his sinne. / After this, thanne cometh swering, that is\r\nexpres agayn the comandement of god; and this bifalleth ofte of anger and\r\nof Ire. / God seith: \'thou shalt nat take the name of thy lord god in veyn\r\nor in ydel.\' Also oure lord Iesu Crist seith by the word of seint Mathew:\r\n\'_Nolite iurare omnino_: / ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere; neither by\r\nhevene, for it is goddes trone; ne by erthe, for it is the bench of his\r\nfeet; ne by Ierusalem, for it is the citee of a greet king; ne by thyn\r\nheed, for thou mayst nat make an heer whyt ne blak. / But seyeth by youre\r\nword, "ye, ye," and "nay, nay"; and what [606] that is more, it is of\r\nyvel,\' seith Crist. /590 For Cristes sake, ne swereth nat so sinfully, in\r\ndismembringe of Crist by soule, herte, bones, and body. For certes, it\r\nsemeth that ye thinke that the cursede Iewes ne dismembred nat y-nough the\r\npreciouse persone of Crist, but ye dismembre him more. / And if so be that\r\nthe lawe compelle yow to swere, thanne rule yow after the lawe of god in\r\nyoure swering, as seith Ieremye _quarto capitulo_, \'_Iurabis in veritate,\r\nin iudido et in iustida_: thou shalt kepe three condicions; thou shalt\r\nswere in trouthe, in doom, and in rightwisnesse.\' / This is to seyn, thou\r\nshalt swere sooth; for every lesinge is agayns Crist. For Crist is verray\r\ntrouthe. And think wel this, that every greet swerere, nat compelled\r\nlawefully to swere, the wounde shal nat departe from his hous whyl he useth\r\nswich unleveful swering. / Thou shalt sweren eek in doom, whan thou art\r\nconstreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe. / Eek thou shalt nat\r\nswere for envye ne for favour, ne for mede, but for rightwisnesse; for\r\ndeclaracioun of it to the worship of god and helping of thyne\r\nevene-cristene. /595 And therfore, every man that taketh goddes name in\r\nydel, or falsly swereth with his mouth, or elles taketh on him the name of\r\nCrist, to be called a Cristene man, and liveth agayns Cristes livinge and\r\nhis techinge, alle they taken goddes name in ydel. / Loke eek what seint\r\nPeter seith, _Actuum quarto capitulo_, \'_Non est aliud nomen sub celo_,\'\r\n&c. \'Ther nis noon other name,\' seith seint Peter, \'under hevene, yeven to\r\nmen, in which they mowe be saved;\' that is to seyn, but the name of Iesu\r\nCrist. / Take kepe eek how that the precious name of Crist, as seith seint\r\nPaul _ad Philipenses secundo_, \'_In nomine Iesu_, &c.: that in the name of\r\nIesu every knee of hevenely creatures, or erthely, or of helle sholden\r\nbowe\'; for it is so heigh and so worshipful, that the cursede feend in\r\nhelle sholde tremblen to heren it y-nempned. / Thanne semeth it, that men\r\nthat sweren so horribly by his blessed name, that they despyse him more\r\nboldely than dide the cursede Iewes, or elles the devel, that trembleth\r\nwhan he hereth his name. /\r\n\r\n    562.

For sith that al the body is the housbondes,\r\nso sholde hir herte been, or elles ther is bitwixe hem two, as in that, no\r\nparfit mariage. / Thanne shal men understonde that for three thinges a man\r\nand his wyf fleshly mowen assemble. The firste is in entente of engendrure\r\nof children to the service of god, for certes that is the cause fynal of\r\nmatrimoine. / Another cause is, to yelden everich of hem to other the dette\r\nof hir bodies, for neither of hem hath power over his owene body. The\r\nthridde is, for to eschewe lecherye and vileinye. The ferthe is for sothe\r\ndeadly sinne. /940 As to the firste, it is meritorie; the seconde also;\r\nfor, as seith the decree, that she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth to\r\nhir housbonde the dette of hir body, ye, though it be agayn hir lykinge and\r\nthe lust of hir herte. / The thridde manere is venial sinne, and trewely\r\nscarsly may ther any of thise be with-oute venial sinne, for the corrupcion\r\nand for the delyt. / The fourthe manere is for to understonde, if they\r\nassemble only for amorous love and for noon of the forseyde causes, but for\r\nto accomplice thilke brenninge delyt, they rekke nevere how ofte, sothly it\r\nis deedly sinne; and yet, with sorwe, somme folk wol peynen hem more to\r\ndoon than to hir appetyt suffyseth. /\r\n\r\n    931.

The firste is,\r\nthat confessioun moste be shamefast, nat for to covere ne hyden his sinne,\r\nfor he hath agilt his god and defouled his soule. / And her-of seith seint\r\nAugustin: \'the herte travailleth for shame of his sinne\'; and for he hath\r\ngreet shamefastnesse, he is digne to have greet mercy of god. /985 Swich\r\nwas the confession of the publican, that wolde nat heven up hise eyen to\r\nhevene, for he hadde offended god of hevene; for which shamefastnesse he\r\nhadde anon the mercy of god. / And ther-of seith seint Augustin, that swich\r\nshamefast folk been next foryevenesse and remissioun. / Another signe is\r\nhumilitee in confessioun; of which seith seint Peter, \'Humbleth yow under\r\nthe might of god.\' The hond of god is mighty in confession, for ther-by god\r\nforyeveth thee thy sinnes; for he allone hath the power. / And this\r\nhumilitee shal been in herte, and in signe outward; for right as he hath\r\nhumilitee to god [637] in his herte, right so sholde he humble his body\r\noutward to the preest that sit in goddes place. / For which in no manere,\r\nsith that Crist is sovereyn and the preest mene and mediatour bitwixe Crist\r\nand the sinnere, and the sinnere is the laste by wey of resoun, /990 thanne\r\nsholde nat the sinnere sitte as heighe as his confessour, but knele biforn\r\nhim or at his feet, but-if maladie destourbe it.

The seconde condicion of verray confession is, that it be hastily\r\ndoon; for certes, if a man hadde a deedly wounde, evere the lenger that he\r\ntaried to warisshe him-self, the more wolde it corrupte and haste him to\r\nhis deeth; and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to hele. / And right so\r\nfareth sinne, that longe tyme is in a man unshewed. / Certes, a man oghte\r\nhastily shewen hise sinnes for manye causes; as for drede of deeth, that\r\ncometh ofte sodenly, and is in no certeyn what tyme it shal be, ne in what\r\nplace; and eek the drecchinge of o synne draweth in another; /1000 and eek\r\nthe lenger that he tarieth, the ferther he is fro Crist.

Now again the shame that a man hath to shryven him, and namely,\r\nthise ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede to\r\nshryven hem; /1060 agayns that shame, sholde a man thinke that, by wey of\r\nresoun, that he that hath nat been ashamed to doon foule thinges, certes\r\nhim oghte nat been ashamed to do faire thinges, and that is confessiouns. /\r\nA man sholde eek thinke, that god seeth and wool alle hise thoghtes and\r\nalle hise werkes; to him may no thing been hid ne covered. / Men sholden\r\neek remembren hem of the shame that is to come at the day of dome, to hem\r\nthat been nat penitent and shriven in this present lyf. / For alle the\r\ncreatures in erthe and in helle shullen seen apertly al that they hyden in\r\nthis world. /\r\n\r\n    1061. ashamed (1)] E. shamed.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 101.

Wanhope is in two maneres: the firste wanhope is in the mercy of\r\nCrist; that other is that they thinken, that they ne mighte nat longe\r\npersevere in goodnesse. /1070 The firste wanhope comth of that he demeth\r\nthat he hath sinned so greetly and so ofte, and so longe leyn in sinne,\r\nthat he shal nat be saved. / Certes, agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he\r\nthinke, that the passion of Iesu Crist is more strong for to unbinde than\r\nsinne is strong for to binde. / Agayns the seconde wanhope, he shal thinke,\r\nthat as ofte as he falleth he may aryse agayn by penitence. And thogh he\r\nnever so longe have leyn in sinne, the mercy of Crist is alwey redy to\r\nreceiven him to mercy. / Agayns the wanhope, that he demeth that he sholde\r\nnat longe persevere in goodnesse, he shal thinke, that the feblesse of the\r\ndevel may no-thing doon but-if men wol suffren him; / and eek he shal han\r\nstrengthe of the help of god, and of al holy chirche, and of the\r\nproteccioun of aungels, if him list. /1075\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa7 103.

IV.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Not the same MS. as that called \'Harl.\' in the foot-notes to Gamelyn.\r\n\r\n[2] It only contains the clerk\'s Tale; see Reliquiae, ii. 68. The Longleat\r\nMS. no. 25, belonging to the Marquis of Bath, contains both the Knight\'s\r\nTale and the Clerk\'s Tale.\r\n\r\n[3] i.e. the gen. case of _physice_; \'Magister Artium et Physices\' occurs\r\nin Longfellow\'s Golden Legend, \xc2\xa7 vi.\r\n\r\n[4] Tyrwhitt counts 252_b_ and 252_c_ as 253 and 254; but omits 3155, 3156;\r\nhence, in 3157-3720, the numbering is alike in the Six-text and T. He then\r\nomits 3721, 3722, making a difference of _two_ lines. Wright follows\r\nTyrwhitt\'s numbering in Group A, and in B 1-1162.\r\n\r\n[5] T. counts B 1982, 1983 as one line; so also B 2002, 2003, and B 2012,\r\n2013, and B 2076, 2077, making a difference of _four_ lines; but, on the\r\nother hand, he expands B 1993 into _three_ lines; hence, on the whole, a\r\ndifference of _two_ lines in this portion. See pp. 192, 193, and note to B\r\n1993 in vol. v.\r\n\r\n[6] Wright counts the lines as I do, but his numbering is in one place\r\nincorrect; after the line which he calls 15260, he counts the next thirteen\r\nlines as ten.\r\n\r\n[7] As in the Six-text, I call each clause of Melibeus between the sloping\r\nmarks _a line_, and so number it. So also in the Parson\'s Tale.\r\n\r\n[8] T. cuts up the Tale into paragraphs. So also in the Parson\'s Tale\r\n(Group I). I have _numbered_ these, for convenience; see head-lines, pp.\r\n199-240.\r\n\r\n[9] Sixteen lines short in Wright, because the Epilogue to the Nonne\r\nPrestes Tale (see p. 289) is relegated to a footnote.\r\n\r\n[10] Twelve lines short; T. omits E 1305-6, F 671-2, 1455-6, 1493-8. Wright\r\nkeeps E 1305-6, but does not count them, and omits the other ten.\r\n\r\n[11] The dash (--) shews where the Groups end or are interrupted.\r\n\r\n[12] The order of the divisions of this tale is different. The \'modern\r\ninstances,\' viz. Peter of Spain, Peter of Cyrus, Barnabo of Lombardy, and\r\nUgolino of Pisa are placed at the end instead of coming in the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Chaucer\'s Works, Volume 4 (of 7) --\r\nThe Canterbury Tales, by Geoffrey Chaucer\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHAUCER\'S WORKS, VOLUME 4 ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 22120-8.txt or 22120-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/1/2/22120/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jonathan Ingram, Keith Edkins and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
