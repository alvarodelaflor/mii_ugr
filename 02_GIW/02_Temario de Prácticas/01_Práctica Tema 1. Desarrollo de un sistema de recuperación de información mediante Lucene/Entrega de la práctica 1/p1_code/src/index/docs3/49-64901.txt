It\r\nhad just the right proportion of interesting items. Schwartz and\r\nWeisinger\'s column was just what was needed--most of their items were\r\nnew and original. Just that!"--Lester Anderson\r\n\r\n"Lovecraft\'s article is getting to be interesting enough to read\r\nthrough now, although I didn\'t think that it was very good during the\r\nfirst few parts. The article on Wells was particularly good."--David\r\nStolaroff\r\n\r\n"The May issue is, I must say, one of the best yet. \'Weird Whisperings\'\r\nand \'Science Fiction in English Magazines\' did I especially enjoy\r\nand am looking forward to the latter\'s promised column on African\r\nstf."--Daniel McPhail\r\n\r\n"I am glad to note that Lovecraft\'s monograph is appearing in larger\r\ninstalments. I hope that Baldwin will continue his \'Side Glances.\' Glad\r\nmy article on M. R. James was approved by so many readers. Later on,\r\nI hope to do some brief articles on other masters of the macabre and\r\nfantastic."--Clark Ashton Smith\r\n\r\n"\'Phantom Lights\' outshines and stifles the reputation of \'Birkett\'s\r\nTwelfth Corpse.\' But \'Dragons\' destroys the illusion of \'Shadows.\'\r\nOrchids to \'The Flower God,\' the best Annal to date, and one of the\r\nchoice stories that has appeared thus far in THE FANTASY FAN."--Robert\r\nNelson\r\n\r\n"THE FANTASY FAN came yesterday and I enjoyed every page. The orange\r\nstock paper improved the appearance greatly. The new type is excellent\r\nalso. The length of \'Our Readers Say\' is just right. It should not be\r\ntoo long."--Duane W. Rimel\r\n\r\n"I have just completed a reading of the May issue of THE FANTASY FAN.\r\nLovecraft and Smith still stand out as my favorites. Some of the other\r\narticles proved quite interesting, particularly \'Weird Whisperings\' and\r\nthe two poems \'Shadows\' and \'Dragons\' were very enjoyable. The colored\r\n\'cover\' marks another step forward. Keep up the good work."--H. Koenig\r\n\r\n"The April issue of THE FANTASY FAN was fine! \'The Ancient Voice\'\r\nby Eando Binder was the best story that I have read in a good many\r\nmoons! And I don\'t mean maybe, either! Mr. Binder held me simply\r\nspellbound from start to finish! Let\'s have many more like this superb\r\ntale!"--Fred John Walsen\r\n\r\n"The strength and beauty of Robert E. Howard\'s \'Gods of the North\' in\r\nyour March issue has influenced me to mark it for frequent re-reading.\r\nNo other of his stories has appealed to me quite so strongly. I\r\nhope that you can induce him to write more stories in the same\r\nvein."--Chester D. Cuthbert\r\n\r\n"Just received May FANTASY FAN and was agreeably surprised to see the\r\n\'cover.\' That\'s one way of getting started on one. \'Weird Whisperings\'\r\nby those master newshawks was very fine. The high spots in the issue\r\nwere Barlow\'s Annals and \'Prose Pastels\' by Smith. I never tire reading\r\neither of these two authors. I enjoy all the poetry you print and\r\nbelieve that you ought to have at least two pages of it."--F. Lee\r\nBaldwin\r\n\r\n"I am enclosing a dollar this time for a full year\'s subscription. I\r\nfind the little mag most interesting. Another thing I like about the\r\nbook is that the Readers\' Sayso includes letters from authors--which\r\nproves that they, too, read stories."--Gertrude Hemken\r\n\r\n"I liked practically everything in the April issue of THE FANTASY FAN.\r\nThe letters in the lengthened \'Our Readers Say\' were interesting, \'Side\r\nGlances\' was allright; you know I liked the feature story very much,\r\nand I was interested in reading the views presented on the topic I\r\nsuggested, and the ads were good. So there!"--Forrest J. Ackerman\r\n\r\n"I enjoy articles by Bob Tucker, Hoy Ping Pong, and Eando Binder\'s\r\nrecent weird narration was fine."--J. Harvey Haggard\r\n\r\n"I devour your magazine like a dog does a bone, but I usually read\r\nit first. The articles that appear beat anything ever written by\r\nShakespeare and makes the works of Poe, Wells, and Verne look\r\namateurish. Lovecraft, Smith, and Howard are the greatest writers\r\nof all time, in any branch of literature. Of course, because of the\r\nexcitement my name would cause if it were printed in your magazine,\r\nplease do not publish this letter. Just be satisfied in knowing that\r\nthe greatest man in the world is one of your readers."--John de Rocka\r\nFella\r\n\r\nSorry, Johnny, old kid, but your letter has already gone to press and\r\nit\'s too late to take it out now. I didn\'t read your last two sentences\r\nuntil too late.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BOOKS OF THE WEIRD\r\n\r\n                         by J. Harvey Haggard\r\n\r\n\r\n"Drums of Dambala" by H. Bedford-Jones is a crackerjack of a weird\r\nnovel in case any of the rest of the fans haven\'t read it. As related\r\nby that master raconteur, we have zombies, ju-ju dances, and lots of\r\nthrilling action on that dark island of ancient magic, Haiti. "The\r\nStory of Superstition," a non-fiction book dealing with the origin of\r\nsuch quaint modern customs as throwing rice and laying corner-stones,\r\nis another absorbing book. After reading it, you\'ll wonder if man has\r\nwholly escaped from his belief in the supernatural after all. "Magic\r\nIsland," by Seabrook, is another non-fiction book that will thrill\r\nyou as much as the most imaginative tale. The author relates his\r\nexperiences in Haiti, in which he goes native with the bushmen and\r\nwitnesses the sacred dance never before beheld by white men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                              From Beyond\r\n\r\n                          by H. P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\n\r\nHorrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my\r\nbest friend, Crawford Tillinghast. I had not seen him since that day,\r\ntwo months and a half before, when he had told me toward what goal\r\nhis physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had\r\nanswered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me\r\nfrom his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage, I had\r\nknown that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with\r\nthat accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the\r\nservants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could\r\nso alter and disfigure any human creature. It is not pleasant to see a\r\nstout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin\r\nbecomes yellowed or greyed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily\r\nglowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous\r\nand twitching. And if added to this there be a repellant unkemptness;\r\na wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots,\r\nand an unchecked growth of white beard on a face once clean-shaven,\r\nthe cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of\r\nCrawford Tillinghast on the night his half coherent message brought me\r\nto his door after my weeks of exile; such was the spectre that trembled\r\nas it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its\r\nshoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house\r\nset back from Benevolent Street.\r\n\r\nThat Crawford Tillinghast should ever have studied science and\r\nphilosophy was a mistake. These things should be left to the frigid and\r\nimpersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives\r\nto the man of feeling and action; despair, if he fail in his quest,\r\nand terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed. Tillinghast\r\nhad once been the prey of failure, solitary and melancholy; but now I\r\nknew, with nauseating fears of my own, that he was the prey of success.\r\nI had indeed warned him ten weeks before, when he burst forth with his\r\ntale of what he felt himself about to discover. He had been flushed and\r\nexcited then, talking in a high and unnatural, though always pedantic,\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"What do we know," he had said, "of the world and the universe about\r\nus? Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our\r\nnotions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow. We see things only\r\nas we are constructed to see them, and can gain no idea of their\r\nabsolute nature. With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the\r\nboundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with a wider, stronger,\r\nor different range of senses might not only see very differently the\r\nthings we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy,\r\nand life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the\r\nsenses we have. I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible\r\nworlds exist at our very elbows, _and now I believe I have found a way\r\nto break down the barriers_. I am not joking. Within twenty-four hours\r\nthat machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized\r\nsense-organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges.\r\nThose waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man, and several\r\nunknown to anything we consider organic life. We shall see that at\r\nwhich dogs howl in the dark, and that at which cats prick up their ears\r\nafter midnight. We shall see these things, and other things which no\r\nbreathing creature has yet seen. We shall overleap time, space, and\r\ndimensions, and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation."\r\n\r\nWhen Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated, for I knew him well\r\nenough to be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic,\r\nand drove me from the house. Now he was no less a fanatic, but his\r\ndesire to speak had conquered his resentment, and he had written me\r\nimperatively in a hand I could scarcely recognize. As I entered the\r\nabode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle,\r\nI became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the\r\nshadows. The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied\r\nforth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light, and I\r\nsickened at the hollow, altered voice of my host. I wished the servants\r\nwere about, and did not like it when he said they had all left three\r\ndays previously. It seemed strange that old Gregory, at least, should\r\ndesert his master without telling as tried a friend as I. It was he\r\nwho had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was\r\nrepulsed in rage.\r\n\r\nYet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and\r\nfascination. Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could\r\nonly guess, but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to\r\nimpart, I could not doubt. Before I had protested at his unnatural\r\npryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to\r\nsome degree I almost shared his spirit, terrible though the cost of\r\nvictory appeared. Up through the dark emptiness of the house I followed\r\nthe bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody of man. The\r\nelectricity seemed to be turned off, and when I asked my guide he said\r\nit was for a definite reason.\r\n\r\n"It would be too much.... I would not dare," he continued to mutter.\r\nI especially noted his new habit of muttering, for it was not like\r\nhim to talk to himself. We entered the laboratory in the attic, and I\r\nobserved that detestable electrical machine, glowing with a sickly,\r\nsinister violet luminosity. It was connected with a powerful chemical\r\nbattery, but seemed to be receiving no current; for I recalled that in\r\nits experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action. In\r\nreply to my question Tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was\r\nnot electrical in any sense that I could understand.\r\n\r\nHe now seated me near the machine, so that it was on my right, and\r\nturned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs.\r\nThe usual sputtering began, turned to a whine, and terminated in\r\na drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence. Meanwhile the\r\nluminosity increased, waned again, then assumed a pale, outre colour or\r\nblend of colours which I could neither place nor describe. Tillinghast\r\nhad been watching me, and noted my puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what that is?" he whispered, "_that is ultra-violet_." He\r\nchuckled oddly at my surprise. "You thought ultra-violet was invisible,\r\nand so it is--but you can see that and many other invisible things\r\n_now_.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me! The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping\r\nsenses in us; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the\r\nstate of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity. I have\r\nseen _truth_, and I intend to show it to you. Do you wonder how it\r\nwill seem? I will tell you." Here Tillinghast seated himself directly\r\nopposite me, blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes.\r\n"Your existing sense-organs--ears first, I think--will pick up many\r\nof the impressions, for they are closely connected with the dormant\r\norgans. Then there will be others. You have heard of the pineal gland?\r\nI laugh at the shallow endocrinologist, fellow-dupe and fellow-parvenu\r\nof the Freudian. That gland is the great sense organ of organs--_I have\r\nfound out_. It is like sight in the end, and transmits visual pictures\r\nto the brain. If you are normal, that is the way you ought to get most\r\nof it.... I mean get most of the evidence _from beyond_."\r\n\r\nI looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall,\r\ndimly lit by rays which the every-day eye cannot see. The far corners\r\nwere all shadows, and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which\r\nobscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and\r\nphantasm. During the interval that Tillinghast was silent I fancied\r\nmyself in some vast and incredible temple of long-dead gods; some\r\nvague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a\r\nfloor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision.\r\nThe picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a\r\nmore horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite,\r\nsightless, soundless space. There seemed to be a void, and nothing\r\nmore, and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my\r\nhip pocket the revolver I always carried after dark since the night I\r\nwas held up in East Providence. Then, from the farthermost regions of\r\nremoteness, the _sound_ softly glided into existence. It was infinitely\r\nfaint, subtly vibrant, and unmistakably musical, but held a quality\r\nof surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate\r\ntorture of my whole body. I felt sensations like those one feels when\r\naccidentally scratching ground glass. Simultaneously there developed\r\nsomething like a cold draught, which apparently swept past me from the\r\ndirection of the distant sound. As I waited breathlessly I perceived\r\nthat both sound and wind were increasing; the effect being to give me\r\nan odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a\r\ngigantic approaching locomotive. I began to speak to Tillinghast, and\r\nas I did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished. I saw only\r\nthe man, the glowing machine, and the dim apartment. Tillinghast was\r\ngrinning repulsively at the revolver which I had almost unconsciously\r\ndrawn, but from his expression I was sure he had seen and heard as much\r\nas I, if not a great deal more. I whispered what I had experienced and\r\nhe bade me remain as quiet and receptive as possible.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t move," he cautioned, "for in these rays _we are able to be seen\r\nas well as to see_. I told you the servants left, but I didn\'t tell you\r\n_how_. It was that thick-witted housekeeper--she turned on the lights\r\ndownstairs after I had warned her not to, and the wires picked up\r\nsympathetic vibrations. It must have been frightful--I could hear the\r\nscreams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another\r\ndirection, and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of\r\nclothes around the house. Mrs. Updike\'s clothes were close to the front\r\nhall switch--that\'s how I know she did it. It got them all. But so\r\nlong as we don\'t move we\'re fairly safe. Remember we\'re dealing with a\r\nhideous world in which we are practically helpless.... _Keep still!_"\r\n\r\nThe combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave\r\nme a kind of paralysis, and in my terror my mind again opened to the\r\nimpressions coming from what Tillinghast called "_beyond_." I was now\r\nin a vortex of sound and motion, with confused pictures before my eyes.\r\nI saw the blurred outlines of the room, but from some point in space\r\nthere seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes\r\nor clouds, penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right\r\nof me. Then I glimpsed the temple-like effect again, but this time the\r\npillars reached up into an aerial ocean of light, which sent down one\r\nblinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before.\r\nAfter that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble\r\nof sights, sounds, and unidentified sense-impressions I felt that I was\r\nabout to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form. One definite\r\nflash I shall always remember. I seemed for an instant to behold a\r\npatch of strange night sky filled with shining, revolving spheres,\r\nand as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation\r\nor galaxy of settled shape; this shape being the distorted face of\r\nCrawford Tillinghast. At another time I felt huge animate things\r\nbrushing past me and occasionally _walking or drifting through my\r\nsupposedly solid body_, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as\r\nthough his better trained senses could catch them visually. I recalled\r\nwhat he had said of the pineal gland, and wondered what he saw with\r\nthis preternatural eye.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight. Over\r\nand above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which, though\r\nvague, held the elements of consistency and permanence. It was indeed\r\nsomewhat familiar, for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual\r\nterrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted\r\ncurtain of a theater. I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical\r\nmachine, and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all\r\nthe space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant.\r\nIndescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting\r\ndisarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien,\r\nunknown entities. It likewise seemed that all the known things entered\r\ninto the composition of other unknown things, and vice versa. Foremost\r\namong the living objects were inky, jellyish monstrosities which\r\nflabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine.\r\nThey were present in loathsome profusion, and I saw to my horror that\r\nthey _over-lapped_; that they were semi fluid and capable of passing\r\nthrough one another and through what we know as solids. These things\r\nwere never still, but seemed ever floating about with some malignant\r\npurpose. Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the attacker\r\nlaunching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the\r\nlatter from sight. Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated\r\nthe unfortunate servants, and could not exclude the things from my mind\r\nas I strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that\r\nlies unseen around us. But Tillinghast had been watching me, and was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n"You see them? You see them? You see the things that float and flop\r\nabout you and through you every moment of your life? You see the\r\ncreatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky? Have I\r\nnot succeeded in breaking down the barrier; have I not shown you worlds\r\nthat no other living men have seen?" I heard his scream through the\r\nhorrible chaos, and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close\r\nto mine. His eyes were pits of flame, and they glared at me with what I\r\nnow saw was overwhelming hatred. The machine droned detestably.\r\n\r\n"You think those floundering things wiped out the servants? Fool, they\r\nare harmless! But the servants _are_ gone, aren\'t they? You tried to\r\nstop me; you discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I\r\ncould get; you were afraid of the cosmic truth, you damned coward, but\r\nnow I\'ve got you! What swept up the servants? What made them scream so\r\nloud?... Don\'t know, eh! You\'ll know soon enough. Look at me--listen to\r\nwhat I say--do you suppose there are really any such things as time\r\nand magnitude. Do you fancy there are such things as form or matter. I\r\ntell you, I have struck depths that your little brain can\'t picture.\r\nI have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down demons from\r\nthe stars.... I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to\r\nworld to sow death and madness.... Space belongs to me, do you hear?\r\nThings are hunting me now--the things that devour and dissolve--but\r\nI know how to elude them. It is you they will get, as they got the\r\nservants.... Stirring, dear sir? I told you it was dangerous to move,\r\nI have saved you so far by telling you to keep still--saved you to see\r\nmore sights and to listen to me. If you had moved, they would have been\r\nat you long ago. Don\'t worry, they won\'t _hurt_ you. They didn\'t hurt\r\nthe servants--it was the _seeing_ that made the poor devils scream so.\r\nMy pets are not pretty, for they come out of places where aesthetic\r\nstandards are--_very different_. Disintegration is quite painless, I\r\nassure you--_but I want you to see them_. I almost saw them, but I knew\r\nhow to stop. You are not curious? I always knew you were no scientist.\r\nTrembling, eh. Trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things I have\r\ndiscovered. Why don\'t you move, then? Tired? Well, don\'t worry, my\r\nfriend, _for they are coming_.... Look, look, curse you, look ... it\'s\r\njust over your left shoulder...."\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be told is very brief, and may be familiar to you from\r\nthe newspaper accounts. The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast\r\nhouse and found us there--Tillinghast dead and me unconscious. They\r\narrested me because the revolver was in my hand, but released me in\r\nthree hours, after they found that it was apoplexy which had finished\r\nTillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious\r\nmachine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor. I\r\ndid not tell very much of what I had seen, for I feared the coroner\r\nwould be skeptical; but from the evasive outline I did give, the doctor\r\ntold me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and\r\nhomicidal madman.\r\n\r\nI wish I could believe that doctor. It would help my shaky nerves if\r\nI could dismiss what I now have to think of the air and the sky about\r\nand above me. I never feel alone or comfortable, and a hideous sense\r\nof pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when I am weary. What\r\nprevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple fact--that the\r\npolice never found the bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford\r\nTillinghast murdered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WEIRD WHISPERINGS\r\n\r\n                        by Schwartz & Weisinger\r\n\r\n\r\nOtis Adelbert Kline died from an operation two years ago!...

Murray Leinster\'s is Will Fitzgerald Jenkins....\r\nRalph Milne Farley\'s is Roger Sherman Hoar.... Farnsworth Wright\r\nhas had several stories and poems published under the nom-de-plume\r\nof Francis Hard.... Desmond Hall, associate editor of _Astounding\r\nStories_, admits having had a story published in _Weird Tales_ under a\r\npseudonym, but won\'t divulge which one.\r\n\r\n"The Vengeance of Fi Fong," another tale of brain transplantation by\r\nBassett Morgan, will soon appear in _Weird Tales_.... Also scheduled\r\nfor early appearances are "Old Sledge" by Paul Ernst and "Distortion\r\nout of Space" by Francis Flagg.... Otis Adelbert Kline\'s _Weird\r\nTales_ story of some years back, "The Bird People," was based on the\r\n_Amazing Stories_ Cover Contest.... Jack Williamson wrote "Born of the\r\nSun" after an argument with Edmond Hamilton, in which the former has\r\nmaintained that no idea was too impossible to make convincing in a\r\nstory.... Arthur J. Burks began his career in _Weird Tales_ under the\r\nname of Estil Critchie because, he explains, "I was ashamed of being\r\nassociated with the stigma of being known as a writer".... An interview\r\nwith Burks, by your scribes, appeared in the April issue of _Author &\r\nComposer_.\r\n\r\nE. Hoffmann Price has moved to Oklahoma where he is using his executive\r\nability and mechanical skill as partner in a garage business.... He\r\nwill soon take to the road in his 1928 Ford Juggernaut and will visit\r\nRobert E. Howard in Cross Plains, Texas, and Clark Ashton Smith in\r\nAuburn, California.... Farnsworth Wright once gave an account of his\r\npet peeve: "My pet peeve is stories that get the character in a very\r\ninteresting dilemma and lead the reader to expect an ingenious solution\r\nof the story only to have the story end with the statement, \'then he\r\nwoke up and found it was a dream.\' Readers have a right to expect the\r\nauthor will offer an interesting denouement, but instead he says \'April\r\nFool\'."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Little Box\r\n\r\n                            by R. H. Barlow\r\n\r\n                        Annals of the Jinns--7\r\n\r\nOn the planet called Loth, in the Seventh City, there lived a\r\nsemi-savage known as Hsuth. He had been captured in his youth by the\r\nfearless raiders of Phargo, but popular demand later caused the release\r\nof all the beings that once formed an interesting collection of the\r\nlarger animals. So it was that one might have had for a neighbor\r\nanything from one of the reddish parrot-people from the far-away\r\nisle of Hin to a pale blue octopus-thing from the dried sea-bed of\r\nInnia. Hsuth, it is to be stated, was neither, being merely one of the\r\ncommon-place brown tailed men from Leek. He was, as are most savages,\r\nvery inquisitive, and one day after returning from the ridna-zat works\r\n(wherein were manufactured first class ornaments to be worn in the\r\nnose) he espied a small black box in the window of a money-lender--a\r\nbox whose curious carvings and tightly closed lid brought up many\r\nquestions. When the dealer refused to open it for him his curiosity was\r\ndoubly whetted, so that he purchased it (after unavoidable delay and\r\nexpected haggling) thereby parting with the earnings of a week.\r\n\r\nReturning home with his prize he managed to slip past a street-brawl\r\nand get inside his house--a three-towered affair resembling an\r\nill-fitted layer cake, each successive story being smaller than the one\r\nupon which it reposed.\r\n\r\nBolting the door he then tried to force the lid open. But it resented\r\nthis move on his part, and showed it by pinching his finger violently.\r\nThis caused him to fling it against the wall. It came to the floor\r\nwith a dull thud and the top fell off after a moment\'s silence. A\r\nsqueaky voice issued from the interior. "--press the control marked A\r\nand the machine will come to him no matter where it is. I am making\r\nthree boxes similar to this and hope that someone will gain some\r\nbenefit, for I haven\'t. Anyone finding this is directed to press the\r\ncontrol marked A and the machine will come to him no matter where it\r\nis iammakingthree-e-e-E-EEE Yah psuhutthush!" declared the little box.\r\nAs Hsuth did not understand what was said, it is to be feared the\r\ndirections were lost upon him, yet some demon directed his finger to\r\nthe control marked A. Perhaps it was because all the other buttons were\r\nhopelessly jammed into the wood.\r\n\r\nNothing happened, and Hsuth disappointedly threw the box through the\r\nwindow where it landed upon the head of a prominent citizen, causing\r\nthat worthy unwonted irritation.\r\n\r\nAnd Hsuth forgot about the box and the fraudulent control marked A,\r\nnot knowing that ten million miles away the machine was battering\r\nceaselessly at its bonds, striving to escape and answer the\r\nlong-awaited call--which it never quite managed to do.\r\n\r\nBut the Leerians gathered round with frightened eyes to watch the\r\nreanimation of the god of the forefathers on that far continent, and\r\noffered up sacrifices in the form of decrepit inhabitants and those who\r\nwould have had them doubt their deity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PROSE PASTELS\r\n\r\n                         by Clark Ashton Smith\r\n\r\n                     _III. The Muse of Hyperborea_\r\n\r\nToo far away is her wan and mortal face, and too remote are the snows\r\nof her lethal breast, for mine eyes to behold them ever. But at whiles\r\nher whisper comes to me, like a chill unearthly wind that is faint from\r\ntraversing the gulfs between the worlds, and has flown over ultimate\r\nhorizons of ice-bound deserts. And she speaks to me in a tongue I have\r\nnever heard but have always known; and she tells of deathly things and\r\nof things beautiful beyond the ecstatic desires of love. Her speech is\r\nnot of good or evil, nor of anything that is desired or conceived or\r\nbelieved by the termites of earth; and the air she breathes, and the\r\nlands wherein she roams, would blast like the utter cold of sidereal\r\nspace; and her eyes would blind the vision of men like suns; and her\r\nkiss, if one should ever attain it, would wither and slay like the kiss\r\nof lightning.\r\n\r\nBut, hearing her far, infrequent whisper, I behold a vision of vast\r\nauroras, on continents that are wider than the world, and seas too\r\ngreat for the enterprise of human keels. And at times I stammer forth\r\nthe strange tidings that she brings: though none will welcome them,\r\nand none will believe or listen. And in some dawn of the desperate\r\nyears, I shall go forth and follow where she calls, to seek the high\r\nand beautific doom of her snow-pale distances, to perish amid her\r\nindesecrate horizons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTell your friends about TFF\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SUPERNATURAL HORROR IN LITERATURE\r\n\r\n                               Part Nine\r\n\r\n                          by H. P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\n                   (copyright 1927 by W. Paul Cook)\r\n\r\n                    IV. The Apex of Gothic Romance\r\n\r\nHorror in literature attains a new malignity in the work of Matthew\r\nGregory Lewis, (1773-1818) whose novel "The Monk" (1795) achieved\r\nmarvelous popularity and earned him the nickname of "Monk" Lewis. This\r\nyoung author, educated in Germany and saturated with a body of wild\r\nTeuton lore unknown to Mrs. Radcliffe, turned to terror in forms more\r\nviolent than his gentle predecessor had ever dared to think of, and\r\nproduced as a result a masterpiece of active nightmare whose general\r\nGothic cast is spiced with added stores of ghoulishness. The story\r\nis one of a Spanish monk, Ambrosio, who from a state of over-proud\r\nvirtue is tempted to the very nadir of evil by a fiend in the guise\r\nof the maiden Matilda; and who is finally, when awaiting death at\r\nthe Inquisition\'s hands, induced to purchase escape at the price of\r\nhis soul from the devil, because he deems both body and soul already\r\nlost. Forthwith the mocking Fiend snatches him to a lonely place,\r\ntells him he has sold his soul in vain since both pardon and a chance\r\nfor salvation were approaching at the moment of his hideous bargain,\r\nand completes the sardonic betrayal by rebuking him for his unnatural\r\ncrimes, and casting his body down a precipice whilst his soul is\r\nborne off forever to perdition. The novel contains some appalling\r\ndescriptions such as the incantation in the vaults beneath the convent\r\ncemetery, the burning of the convent, and the final end of the wretched\r\nabbot. In the sub-plot where the Marquis de las Cisternas meets the\r\nspectre of his erring ancestress, The Bleeding Nun, there are many\r\nenormously potent strokes, notably the visit of the animated corpse to\r\nthe Marquis\'s bedside, and the cabalistic ritual whereby the Wandering\r\nJew helps him to fathom and banish his dead tormentor. Nevertheless,\r\n"The Monk" drags sadly when read as a whole. It is too long and too\r\ndiffuse, much of its potency is marred by flippancy and by an awkwardly\r\nexcessive reaction against those canons of decorum which Lewis at first\r\ndespised as prudish. One great thing may be said of the author; that\r\nhe never ruined his ghostly visions with a natural explanation. He\r\nsucceeded in breaking up the Radcliffian tradition and expanding the\r\nfield of the Gothic novel. Lewis wrote much more than "The Monk." His\r\ndrama, "The Castle Spectre," was produced in 1798, and he later found\r\ntime to pen other fiction in ballad form--"Tales of Terror," (1799)\r\n"Tales of Wonder," (1801) and a succession of translations from Germany.\r\n\r\nGothic romances, both English and German, now appeared in multitudinous\r\nand mediocre profusion. Most of them were merely ridiculous in the\r\nlight of mature taste, and Miss Austen\'s famous satire "Northanger\r\nAbbey" was by no means an unmerited rebuke to a school which had\r\nsunk far toward absurdity. This particular school was petering out,\r\nbut before its final subordination there arose its last and greatest\r\nfigure in the person of Charles Robert Maturin, (1782-1824) an obscure\r\nand eccentric Irish clergyman. Out of an ample body of miscellaneous\r\nwriting which includes one confused Radcliffian imitation called "The\r\nFatal Revenge; or, The Family of Montorio," (1807) Maturin at length\r\nevolved the vivid horror-masterpiece of "Melmoth, the Wanderer," (1820)\r\nin which the Gothic tale climbed to altitudes of sheer spiritual fright\r\nwhich it had never known before.\r\n\r\n"Melmoth" is the tale of an Irish gentleman who, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, obtained a preternaturally extended life from the Devil at\r\nthe price of his soul. If he can persuade another to take the bargain\r\noff his hands, and assume his existing state, he can be saved; but\r\nthis he can never manage to effect, no matter how assiduously he\r\nhaunts those whom despair has made reckless and frantic. The framework\r\nof the story is very clumsy; involving tedious length, digressive\r\nepisodes, narratives within narratives, and laboured dovetailing\r\nand coincidences; but at various points in the endless rambling,\r\nthere is felt a pulse of power undiscoverable in any previous work\r\nof this kind--a kinship to the essential truth of human nature, an\r\nunderstanding of the profoundest sources of actual cosmic fear, and a\r\nwhite heat of sympathetic passion on the writer\'s part, which makes\r\nthe book a true document of aesthetic self-expression rather than a\r\nmere clever compound of artifice. No unbiased reader can doubt that\r\nwith "Melmoth" an enormous stride in the evolution of the horror-tale\r\nis represented. Fear is taken out of the realm of the conventional and\r\nexalted into a hideous cloud over mankind\'s very destiny. Maturin\'s\r\nshudders, the work of one capable of shuddering himself, are of the\r\nsort that convince. Mrs. Radcliffe and Lewis are fair game for the\r\nparodist, but it would be difficult to find a false note in the\r\nfeverishly intensified action and high atmospheric tension of the\r\nIrishman whose less sophisticated emotions and strain of Celtic\r\nmysticism gave him the finest possible natural equipment for his task.\r\nWithout a doubt, Maturin is a man of authentic genius, and he was so\r\nrecognized by Balzac, who grouped "Melmoth" with Moliere\'s "Don Juan,"\r\nGoethe\'s "Faust," and Byron\'s "Manfred" as the supreme allegorical\r\nfigures of modern European literature, and wrote a whimsical piece\r\ncalled "Melmoth Reconciled," in which the Wanderer succeeds in passing\r\nhis infernal bargain on to a Parisian bank defaulter, who in turn\r\nhands it along a chain of victims, until a gambler dies with it in\r\nhis possession, and by his damnation ends the curse. Scott, Rossetti,\r\nThackeray and Baudelaire are other titans who gave Maturin their\r\nunqualified admiration, and there is much significance in the fact that\r\nOscar Wilde, after his disgrace and exile, chose for his last days in\r\nParis the assumed name of "Sebastian Melmoth."\r\n\r\n\r\n                        (continued next month)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WITHIN THE CIRCLE\r\n\r\n                           by F.

Hoffmann Price is touring the Southwest and is planning to call on\r\nRobert E. Howard, dip into Mexico, stop at Clark Ashton Smith\'s and\r\nfinally wind up in San Francisco. His beloved rugs are with him.\r\n\r\n"The Curse of Yig" by Zealia Brown Reed has been reprinted in the S & B\r\n(London) "Not at Night" anthology a few years ago.\r\n\r\nForrest Ackerman on binding stf: "--Place together evenly all pages to\r\nbe bound into one booklet; with thumbtack, press two holes thru pages,\r\nholes being as far apart as the wire clips removed from original copies\r\nof magazines containing the stories or parts of serial; push clip thru\r\nthese two holes near top of magazine and bend together at back, then\r\nrepeating operation near bottom. Story is now clipped together. Backs\r\nand covers can now easily be put on by use of adhesive paper.--Does\r\nthat help you?"\r\n\r\n"The Horror in the Museum," by Hazel Heald is scheduled for reprinting\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nHere\'s one about Edgar Allan Poe: Mrs. Whitman, poetess, suggested that\r\nPoe remove the last stanza from his poem "Ulalume" as she thought it\r\ndetracted from the work. He did, and there are very few of the younger\r\nPoe admirers who have seen it. Modern standard Editions don\'t contain\r\nthis bit; it is only the older ones that do.\r\n\r\nHoward Wandrei, Don\'s brother, is a weird painter of the most unusual\r\norder. His work is far beyond that of any weird illustrator employed by\r\nmagazines, in my opinion.... Have a look some time you Editors who want\r\nto be surprised! Howard illustrated Donald\'s "Dark Odyssey."\r\n\r\nHere are the stories in the "Randolph Carter Series" by H. P.\r\nLovecraft. They were written as follows: "Statement of Randolph Carter"\r\n(1919), "The Silver Key" (1926), "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"\r\n(1926-7, unpublished), and the collaboration with E. Hoffmann Price,\r\n"Through the Gates of the Silver Key".... "At the Mountains of Madness"\r\nwas written in the Spring of 1831 and "The Shadow over Innsmouth" was\r\nwritten in November of the same year. His latest tale is "The Thing on\r\nthe Doorstep" written in August, 1933.\r\n\r\nFor those who would like to read some of the classics of weird fiction\r\ntry "John Silence" by Algernon Blackwood, "The Willows" by the same\r\nauthor (found in "The Best Ghost Stories" edited by Bohun Lynch), "The\r\nThree Imposters" by Arthur Machen (Alfred A. Knopf, Publisher, N. Y.),\r\n"The Turn of the Screw" by Henry James (found in "The Two Magics" by\r\nthe same author), "The White People" by Arthur Machen (found in "The\r\nHouse of Souls" published by Alfred A.

E.\r\nCleator, who is President of the British Interplanetary Society. This\r\ncolumn reports latest news flashes of rocketeers and interplanetary\r\nprojects all over the world. Two other departments called "Here\'s a\r\nScoop" and "Modern Marvels" list the latest inventions, scientific\r\ndiscoveries, etc. Another column, "Can it be Done?" presents an\r\nillustration of some badly needed device or invention, and asks readers\r\nto try to invent them. The readers page occupies the back cover at\r\npresent and quite a few good arguments are put up. It needs some\r\nAmerican letters though, so get busy Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Darrow!\r\n\r\nSeveral requests have been received for information on this magazine,\r\nso here it is: _Scoops_ is published weekly at 18 Henrietta St.,\r\nLondon, WC2, England. Yearly subscription price is 13s, or about $3.40.\r\nRemittance can be made in American postal money orders. English money\r\nvalues are not steady, in regards to American money, so the $3.40 may\r\nbe either more, or less, when you subscribe. _Scoops_ contains, on an\r\naverage, 28 pages. It has a cover in two or three colors, depicting\r\nsome scene from a story, or some scientific feat. The size of the\r\nmagazine is 9 X 12 inches, and has small type, thus quite a lot of\r\nreading matter is put out, considering its small price of about 6 cents\r\nfor a copy.\r\n\r\nYou can either subscribe for three months, six months, or a year. The\r\nthree month price is three shillings and three pence. Six months is\r\njust double that. One year is 13 shillings. [We hope to present another\r\narticle in this series very soon.

Most stories react upon one rather distantly. They\r\ncommunicate merely a distant mental fear, and not a physical fear. If\r\nI were to choose the most entertaining book I have ever read, I would\r\nunquestionably name \'Seven Footprints to Satan\' by A. Merritt. Just\r\nas unhesitatingly I would name him as the insuperable weird writer,\r\nsince I have never experienced the physical fleshly cowardice of the\r\npreternatural, either in actual life or in imaginative reconstruction\r\nof fiction, more vividly than when I contacted Lucifer in person in\r\nthat book.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
